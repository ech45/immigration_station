            <p>This project is conducted by students Christopher Montgomery, Eric Hue, Elaina
                Zachos, and Zachary Enick under the guidance of Dr. David Birnbaum, Gabi Keane, and
                Kaylen Sanders in the course Computational Methods of the Humanities at the
                University of Pittsburgh. The scope of this research is to identify rhetorical
                patterns in candidate speech in the 2016 Presidential debates largely through the
                use of metaphorical language, word repetition, and referential terms.</p>
