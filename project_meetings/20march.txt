today's topic: Analysis of debates -- what are we planning on doing?

How do we orient graphics with analysis?
   Side by side? Pop-up? NOT on different pages
   
Candidate analyses
   index.xhtml/Candidates/Republicans(or Democrats)/page with photos
   donne.obdurodon.org textual presentation might have some good ideas
   radio buttons on the top of the screen to identify trope types with a list of subtypes associated with that type available to select
   candidate section -- aggregate all candidate utterances and organize them semantically//debate section -- list of entire debates to better see context
     link the utterances in each location???
     html development: Wrap the relevent sections of debates in a div and write code that either shows or hides non-relevent parts of the debate
     
models and figures
   use a dynamic bar graph to identify what words were used by candidates
   percentage of total speech in debate and percentage of total speech pertaining to immigration by candidate
   Tropes will be used mostly as navigation tools because of their subjective nature
   
Responsibilities
   One person to make readable debate documents
   Reformatting xml documents to ready them for html publishing
   Write an xsl stylesheet to manipulate the debate content
   **how will we divide the candidate's utterances?**
   Start developing candidate and debate pages on site
