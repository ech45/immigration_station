<trope>Our politicians are stupid. And the Mexican government is much smarter, much
        sharper, much more cunning. And they send the bad ones over because they don't want to pay
        for them. They don't want to take care of them. Why should they when the stupid leaders of
        the United States will do it for them? And that's what is happening whether you like it or
        not.</trope>

<!-- For this one, I know it's a series of several tropes, but where one ends and another begins is my chief question. -->

        It's hurting us economically. It's hurting us
        from every standpoint. It's causing tremendous difficulty with respect to drugs and what
        that does to many of our inner cities in particular. And it really is — was such an
        unbelievable moment because the courts have not been ruling in our favor. And it was a 2-1
        decision. And it was a terrific thing that happened. And I will tell you, we are a country
        of laws. We need borders. We will have a wall. The wall will be built. The wall will be
        successful. And if you think walls don't work, all you have to do is ask Israel. The wall
        works, believe me. Properly done. Believe me.

        --- I like welfare for this one because while he references them as being "bad" thus implying them to be criminals,
        the majority of his speech is concerned with "paying for them" which invokes the whole illegal immigrant welfare abuse idea,
        even if he was refering to paying for their prison cells.
