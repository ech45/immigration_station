<trope>Our politicians are stupid. And the Mexican government is much smarter, much
        sharper, much more cunning. And they send the bad ones over because they don't want to pay
        for them. They don't want to take care of them. Why should they when the stupid leaders of
        the United States will do it for them? And that's what is happening whether you like it or
        not.</trope>
