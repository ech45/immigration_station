<!--Should "deportation" be a keyword?-->
<sentence> He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every
            <immigrant status="illegal" term="undocumented person">undocumented person</immigrant> would be subject to deportation.

<!--What should we do about quotes from other sources?-->
    <speech speaker="WALLACE">I want to ask you about a statement that you made last year about <immigrant status="illegal" term="illegal immigrant">illegal immigrants</immigrant>. And here's what you said. "They broke the law, but it's not a felony, it's an
        act of love. It's an act of commitment to your family." Do you stand by that statement and
        do you stand by your support for earned legal status?</speech>
 <!--And later:-->
     <speech speaker="WALLACE">Thank you, sir. [applause] Mr. Trump, it has not escaped anybody's
        notice that you say that the Mexican government, the Mexican government is sending criminals
        ... rapists, drug dealers, across the <key_word term="border">border</key_word>. Governor Bush has called those remarks, quote,
        "extraordinarily ugly."

<!--Should each utterance have an attitude? Later in this example, we note Bush has a "pro" immigration attitude but right here it seems like he has an "anti" one.-->
<speech speaker="BUSH">I do. <trope type="values" subtype="family">I believe that the great majority of people coming here illegally
        have no other option. They want to provide for their family.</trope>

<!--Should "fence" be tagged as "wall" or another keyword?-->
<speech speaker="RUBIO">Those countries are the source
        of the people that are now coming in its majority. I also believe we need a fence.

<trope>Our politicians are stupid. And the Mexican government is much smarter, much
        sharper, much more cunning. And they send the bad ones over because they don't want to pay
        for them. They don't want to take care of them. Why should they when the stupid leaders of
        the United States will do it for them? And that's what is happening whether you like it or
        not.</trope>

<!-- For this one, I know it's a series of several tropes, but where one ends and another begins is my chief question. -->

        It's hurting us economically. It's hurting us
        from every standpoint. It's causing tremendous difficulty with respect to drugs and what
        that does to many of our inner cities in particular. And it really is — was such an
        unbelievable moment because the courts have not been ruling in our favor. And it was a 2-1
        decision. And it was a terrific thing that happened. And I will tell you, we are a country
        of laws. We need borders. We will have a wall. The wall will be built. The wall will be
        successful. And if you think walls don't work, all you have to do is ask Israel. The wall
        works, believe me. Properly done. Believe me.

        --- I like welfare for this one because while he references them as being "bad" thus implying them to be criminals,
        the majority of his speech is concerned with "paying for them" which invokes the whole illegal immigrant welfare abuse idea,
        even if he was refering to paying for their prison cells.
