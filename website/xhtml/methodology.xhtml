            <h2><strong>Critical Discourse Theory</strong></h2>
<h3> In contrast to more traditional lines of inquiry localized to the political sciences, this project employs critical discourse analytical methods in its analysis of speech acts concerning immigration during the 2016 presidential campaign season. Rather than analyze the potential implications of platforms proposed by presidential candidates, this projects concerns itself with the 
linguistic underpinnings that make such platforms politically feasible. We argue that vastly different immigration and immigration reform proposals put forth during the 2016 presidential election cycle are rooted in as much, if not more, a given candidate's immigration rhetoric as opossed to a so-called fact based reality.  </h3>
