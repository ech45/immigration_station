            <strong>Critical Discourse Theory</strong>
                <br/>
            In contrast to more traditional lines of inquiry localized to the political
                sciences, this project employs critical discourse analysis methods in its analysis
                of speech acts concerning immigration during the 2016 presidential campaign season.
                Rather than analyze the potential implications of platforms proposed by presidential
                candidates, this projects concerns itself with the linguistic underpinnings that
                necessitate such platforms. We argue that vastly different immigration and
                immigration reform proposals put forth during the 2016 presidential election cycle
                were rooted in as much, if not more, a given candidate's immigration rhetoric as
                opossed to any so-called fact based reality. Rather, in keeping with the post-modern
                traditions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault">Michael Focault</a>, we aim to demonstrate that knowledge and reality are
                constructs of language, rather than objective truths . Thus, advocacy for building a wall along the United
                States' southern border can be a viable platform for constituencies that use the
                phrase "illegal immigrant"- just as amnesty and a pathway to citizenship can be
                fitting for those who use the terms "dreamer" and "undocumented."

            <strong>Political Discourse and the 2016 Election Cycle</strong>
            <br/>
             Defining exactly what constitutes political discourse can prove to be its own
                endeavor. For simplicity's sake, we find van Djik's definition of political to be most poinent: "the easiest, and not altogether misguided,
                answer is that political discourse is identified by its actors or authors, viz.,
                politicians." <a href="http://discourses.org/OldArticles/What%20is%20Political%20Discourse%20Analysis.pdf">-Teun van Djik </a>
            Nevertheless, we feel it necessary to explicate further our decision to analyze immigration discourse from the 2016 presidential election cycle. Without a doubt, rhetoric from the 22 analyzed presidential candidates running for election constitutes political discourse. However, we will argue that the 2016 presidential election campaign season marked a moment of inflated 
            political participation- both in terms of candidates and constituents. On the campaign trail candidates engaged in a considerable number of discursive acts including speeches, rallys, town-halls, and debates. At the same time, a record number of recipients attended, listened, and viewed these speech acts. Thus, we contend that the heightened degree
            of political participation during the 2016 presdiential election cycle, on account of politicians and constitutents, marks an appropriate moment to analyze political discourse on immigration.

         <strong>Concerning Method</strong> <br/>
           In our XML markup phase we focused on two levels of rhetorical analysis. On one level, tagged individual words that were relevant to immigration rhetoric. Words describing immigrants, illegal/undocumented immigrants, or refugees recieved the tag "immigrant" with attribute values "status," denoting the subject's legal immigratory status and "term" denoting the actual term used by the candidate. Immigration related terms recieved identical
           treatment, however under the tag "immigration" instead. In addition we included "keyword" tags, which were used on individual words or phrases pertaining to immigration such as amnesty, border, wall, pathway to citizenship, or Dreamer. <br/>
           On the second linguistic level, we marked what we called "tropes." Trope tags, as inspired by the "frames of reference" described in Dr. Luke Peterson's <em>Israel Palestine in the Print Media</em>, were used to describe any speech utterances that disucssed immigration in terms of a specific ideological positions, or frames of reference. These ideological dispositions are often rooted in a candidate's
           definition of a given issue, and propogate an emotional rather than objective or fact based response. Thus, utterances such as "the
           fact is, since then, many killings, murders, crime, drugs pouring across the
           border, are money going out and the drugs
           coming in," employs a homeland security frane of reference. By this perspective illegal immigration should be viewed as a harbinger of crime, drugs, and death to innocent Americans. Other tropes employ economic and American value based statements in order to define immigration in a positive or negative light. In our markup, we tagged sentence similar to our example denoting the trope's "type" grouped as economic, national security, and American values. Then, when applicable these tropes were
           given a subtype to further specifiy an observed fram of reference. Thus, the latte example would be tagged with the "trope" element, "secure" type, and "crime drugs" subtype denoting a frame of reference that depicts immigrants as criminals and drug pushers.
