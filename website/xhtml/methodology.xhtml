            <strong>Critical Discourse Theory</strong>
                <br/>
            In contrast to more traditional lines of inquiry localized to the political
                sciences, this project employs critical discourse analysis methods in its analysis
                of speech acts concerning immigration during the 2016 presidential campaign season.
                Rather than analyze the potential implications of platforms proposed by presidential
                candidates, this projects concerns itself with the linguistic underpinnings that
                necessitate such platforms. We argue that vastly different immigration and
                immigration reform proposals put forth during the 2016 presidential election cycle
                were rooted in as much, if not more, a given candidate's immigration rhetoric as
                opossed to any so-called fact based reality. Rather, in keeping with the post-modern
                traditions of Michael Focault, we aim to demonstrate that knowledge and reality are
                constructs of language, rather than objective truths <span class="footnote"><a
                        href="1">1</a></span>. Thus, advocacy for building a wall along the United
                States' southern border can be a viable platform for constituencies that use the
                phrase "illegal immigrant"- just as amnesty and a pathway to citizenship can be
                fitting for those who use the terms "dreamer" and "undocumented." <span
                    class="footnote"><a href="2">2</a></span>
                </p>

            <strong>Political Discourse and the 2016 Election Cycle</strong>
            <br/>
             Defining exactly what constitutes political discourse can prove to be its own
                endeavor. For simplicity's sake, we find van Djik's definition of political to be most poinent: "the easiest, and not altogether misguided,
                answer is that political discourse is identified by its actors or authors, viz.,
                politicians." -Teun van Djik <span class="footnote"><a href="3">3</a></span>
            Nevertheless, we feel it necessary to explicate further our decision to analyze immigration discourse from the 2016 presidential election cycle. Without a doubt, rhetoric from the 22 analyzed presidential candidates running for election constitutes political discourse. However, we will argue that the 2016 presidential election campaign season marked a moment of inflated 
            political participation- both in terms of candidates and constituents. On the campaign trail candidates engaged in a considerable number of discursive acts including speeches, rallys, town-halls, and debates. At the same time, a record number of recipients attended, listened, and viewed these speech acts. <span class="footnote"><a href="4">4</a></span> Thus, we contend that the heightened degree
            of political participation during the 2016 presdiential election cycle, on account of politicians and constitutents, marks an appropriate moment to analyze political discourse on immigration.
