The new normal of two percent that the left is saying you can't do anything about is so dangerous for our country. There's 6 million people living in poverty today, more than when Barack Obama got elected. 6.5 million people are working part-time, most of whom want to work full-time. We've created rules and taxes on top of every aspiration of people, and the net result is we're not growing fast, income's not growing. A four percent growth strategy means you fix a convoluted tax code. You get in and you change every aspect of regulations that are job killers. You get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something that doesn't suppress wages and kill jobs. [applause]

You embrace the energy revolution in our country. This president and Hillary Clinton, who can't even say she's for the XL pipeline even after she's left? Give me a break. Of course we're for it. We should be for these things to create high sustained economic growth. And frankly, [timer sounds] fixing our immigration system and turning it into an economic driver is part of this as well. We can do this. [applause]

            rather than turning it into an economic driver. We're not protecting and preserving our
            entitlement system or reforming for the next generation. All these things languish while

                the Syrians themselves. And I asked them: What do you want? What is your supreme
                desire? Their supreme desire was to be settled back in their own country. I said,
                "What can Americans and other countries do?" They said, "Support the efforts of
                those who are trying to provide safety for us, including the Jordanians." Of course,
                they had a brand new hospital, for instance, that was unstaffed because there wasn't
                enough money to do it. But here's what's really neat. If you go into Hasakah
                province in northeast Syria, that's an area that's as big as Lebanon. It's
                controlled by the Kurds, the Christians and the moderate Sunnis. And there are
                airstrips and hotels. You could settle a lot of people there. All we would have to
                do is be willing to provide them with some weaponry, some defensive weaponry. And we
                seem to be afraid to give the Kurds weaponry. We like to send it for some strange
                reason through Baghdad, and then they only get a tenth of it. And if we would

               <a href="debate_repub_2016-01-14.xhtml#speech114">[source] </a>Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of
                state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot. You think about
                it — this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state — drew a red
                line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're
                going to attack. He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a
                million of his own people, and this president has done nothing. In fact, he's done
                worse than nothing. This president — and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called
                Assad a reformer — she called Assad a reformer. Now, the fact is, what this
                president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir
                Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we
                have today? We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight
                ISIS, but to prop up Assad. The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace
                — we are not going to have peace in Syria. We're not going to be able to rebuild it
                unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to
                be talking about <span class="immigrant">Syrian
                    refugees</span> anymore. The Syrians should stay in Syria. They shouldn't
                be going to Europe. And here's the last piece...[applause]...you're not going to
                have peace in Syria with Assad in charge. You're simply not. And so Senator Graham
                is right about this. And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor
                Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries
                that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace,
                and bring them together. And believe me, Assad is not worth it. And if you're going
                to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the
                architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm
                speaking out as strongly as I am about that. Hillary Clinton cannot be president. It
                will lead to even greater war in this world. And remember this, after Hillary
                Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the
                world than we had when they started. That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
                In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the
                Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.</p>

                was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. He was the
                U.S. Attorney in Manhattan. He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law
                enforcement in this country." Here's why, the president of the United States and
                both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not
                to the police officers. That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time
                with this president. Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to —
                remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time. This is a guy
                who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys. Now, I for seven years was
                the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. I worked hard with not only federal agents but with
                police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in
                this country. That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't
                enforce the immigration laws. And this president turns his back — this president
                doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with
                them. And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance
                that's illegal. This president allows lawlessness throughout this country. Here's
                what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very
                brief conversation with that Attorney General. I'd say, "General, enforce the law
                against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively. Make our streets safe again. Make
                our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them
                know how proud we are of them." We do that, this country would be safe and secure
                again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well. I'm
                the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President

               <a href="debate_repub_2016-02-06.xhtml#speech242">[source] </a>Well, thank you for that question. You know, there are three
                avenues of presidential authority to change the direction of this country. The first
                is executive power, the second is foreign policy, and the third is legislation.
                Executive power, as we all know, has been the preferred vehicle of President Obama,
                abusing his authority, abusing his constitutional authority. Now, the silver lining
                of that is everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power,
                so I have pledged on day one I will rescind every single illegal and
                unconstitutional executive action Barack Obama has done. That means on day one his
                efforts to restrict the Second Amendment go away with the strike of a pen. That
                means on day one his illegal executive <span class="keyword amnesty">amnesty</span> goes away with the strike of a pen.
                The reason I can end Common Core at the federal level is because Obama is abusing
                executive power using Race to the Top funds in the Department of Education to force
                it on the states. That's one avenue. The second avenue of change is foreign policy,
                and foreign policy can change the fastest. It's worth remembering that Iran released
                our hostages the day Reagan...[bell rings]...was sworn in. And, the third is
                legislation, and that can only be done with the people behind you, which is why the
                two big legislative initiatives I'm campaigning on are repealing Obamacare, and
                adopting a simple flat tax to abolish the IRS. [applause]</p>

               <a href="debate_repub_2016-02-06.xhtml#speech259">[source] </a>Well, Josh, as you noted, this is a problem that, for me, I
                understand first-hand. My older sister, Myriam, who was my half- sister, struggled
                her whole life with drug and alcohol addiction. My father and her mom divorced when
                she was a little girl and she was angry her whole life, and she ended up marrying a
                man who had been in and out of jail. She then became a single mom and she herself
                went to jail several times and she ended up spending some time in a crack house. I
                still remember my father and me driving up to get Myriam out of that crack house to
                try to convince her she needed to be a mom to — to my nephew Joey. She wasn't
                willing to listen. She was not willing to change the path she was on. She was angry.
                I was — had just gotten my first job coming out of law school. I took a $20,000 loan
                on a credit card to put my nephew, Joey, in Valley Forge Military Academy — he was
                in sixth grade at the time, to pay his way through that. And about five, six years
                ago, Miriam died of an overdose. It was — the coroner ruled it accidental. We don't
                know. She went to one night, had taken too many pills, and Joey walked in and found
                her dead. This is an absolute epidemic. We need leadership to solve it. Solving it
                has to occur at the state and local level with programs like A.A., and counseling,
                and churches and charities. But it also has to be securing the <span class="keyword border">borders</span>, because you
                have got Mexican cartels that are smuggling vast amounts of heroin into this
                country. We know how to secure the <span class="keyword border">borders</span>. What is missing is the political will to
                do it. And as president, I will secure the <span class="keyword border">border</span>, we will end this deluge of drugs
                that is flowing over our southern <span class="keyword border">border</span> and that is killing Americans across this

I opposed TPP and have always opposed TPP, which is what you asked about. And when it comes to trade, look, free trade, when we open up foreign markets, helps Americans. But we're getting killed in international trade right now. And we're getting killed because we have an administration that's doesn't look out for American workers and jobs are going overseas. We're driving jobs overseas.
And the people who are losing out are in manufacturing jobs, or the steel industry or the auto industry. But I'll tell you who else is going to be losing out, which is the service industry. This Obama administration is negotiating the Trade in Services Agreement which is another treaty to allow services to come in and take jobs from Americans as well.

Number one, we need to negotiate trade deals protecting American workers first, not the corporate board room. Number two, we need to lift the regulations on American businesses here so we see jobs coming back.

               <a href="debate_repub_2015-12-15.xhtml#speech308">[source] </a> You know, obviously, as president of the United States, we've
                got to keep the people safe. That's first and foremost. But as governor of Ohio, I
                have an obligation to keep the 11.5 million people in Ohio safe. And we have been
                very effective with our Joint Terrorism Task Force, being able to make busts. In
                fact, we just made one three-four weeks ago against a person who was favorable to
                ISIS living in Akron. But let me tell you what is interesting about the
                administration. We had Central American miners that were placed in Ohio, and we
                never knew a thing about it. We didn't know where they were. And, in fact, we know
                now that some of them, there is a case going on where some of them may have been
                human-trafficked. So when the administration tells me we have a great vetting
                process, the proof is in the pudding. They sent these miners to us. Our schools were
                disrupted. We didn't know where they were. And bad things happened to them. And now
                they tell me that we ought to be able to admit these <span class="immigrant">Syrian refugees</span>. So, Wolf, look, people have
                accused me at times of having too big of a heart. You know, that's OK. But I have to
                also to say I must keep the people of my state safe. So we take a pause.</p>

                them. But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category. And I'll go
                back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago. <span class="trope secure">If we're going to have a
                    coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the
                    western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need
                    the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states. We need Jordan.
                    We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put
                    together in the first Gulf War. [bell rings] It was a coalition made up of Arabs
                    and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again. And if we try to
                    put everybody in the same — call everybody the same thing, we can't do
                    it.</span> And that's just not acceptable. But I think a pause on <span class="immigrant">Syrian refugees</span> has been
                exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course,
                for me as the governor of Ohio.</p>

                then for the 11.5 million that are here, if they have not committed a crime since

The simple fact of the matter is I wouldn't be standing here. I'd be maybe running for president of Croatia if we didn't have <span class="immigration">immigration</span>.
<span class="trope value">
                  <span class="immigration">Immigration</span> is something that brings youth and vibrance and energy to our country.</span> But we clearly have to control our <span class="keyword border">borders</span>. We can't have people just walking in. Look, we lock our doors at night in our homes. The country has to be able to lock its doors as well. So, we — I have a comprehensive plan to deal with this problem of <span class="immigration">immigration</span>.
I would say we have to absolutely finish the <span class="keyword wall">wall</span> and guard the <span class="keyword border">border</span>. And if anybody were to come in after that, they are going to have to go back. No excuses because we can't continue this problem. I think we ought to have a <span class="immigrant">guest worker</span> program, where people come in, work and go home.
And I think at the same time, for the 11 and a half million who are here, then in my view if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, they get a path to legalization. Not to citizenship. I believe that program can pass the Congress in the first 100 days.
<span class="trope econ">But let's not lose sight of the fact that the whole key to the future of America is strong economic growth with common sense regulation, lower taxes and a balanced budget.</span>
We can have a rising tide that lifts all the workers in America, all the people who are citizens of America, if we'll just follow the formula that works, that I used in Washington. And guess what, I've used it in Ohio to grow over 400 private sector jobs since I've been governor

We need to control our <span class="keyword border">border</span> just like people have to control who goes in and out of their house.

<span class="trope values">But if people think that we are going to ship 11 million people who are law-abiding, who are in this country, and somehow pick them up at their house and ship them out of Mexico — to Mexico, think about the families. Think about the children.</span>

So, you know what the answer really is? If they have been law- abiding, they pay a penalty. They get to stay. We protect the <span class="keyword wall">wall</span>. Anybody else comes over, they go back.

But for the 11 million people, come on, folks. We all know you can't pick them up and ship them across, back across <span class="keyword border">the border</span>. It's a silly argument. It is not an adult argument. It makes no sense. [applause]

                you to Norwood University for their wonderful hospitality and the Commission on
                Presidential Debates. It's deeply humbling for me to be here, to be surrounded by my

                well. And I just — I also want to say — I want to say thanks to everyone that's
                looking in tonight, who understands what an enormously important time this is in the
                life of our nation. For the last seven-and-a-half years, we've seen America's place
                in the world weakened. We've seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation,
                a war on coal, and a failing health care reform come to be known as Obamacare, and
                the American people know that we need to make a change. And so I want to thank all
                of you for being — being with us tonight. I also want to thank Donald Trump for
                making that call and inviting us to be a part of this ticket. I have to tell you,
                I'm a — I'm a small-town boy from a place not too different from Farmville. I grew
                up with a cornfield in my backyard. <span class="anecdote value">My grandfather had immigrated to this country

                a small town in Southern Indiana. They built a family and — and a good name and a
                business. And they raised a family.</span> And I dreamed some day of representing my home
                town in Washington, D.C., but I — honestly, Elaine, I never imagined — never
                imagined I'd have the opportunity to be governor of the state that I love, let alone
                be sitting at a table like this in this kind of a position. So to answer your

                me in this role, that I would meet it with the way that I'm going to meet the
                responsibility should I be elected vice president of the United States. And that's
                to bring a lifetime of experience, a lifetime growing up in a small town, a lifetime
                where I've served in the Congress of the United States, where — where I've led a
                state that works in the great state of Indiana, and whatever other responsibilities
                might follow from this, I — I would hope and, frankly, I would pray to be able to
                meet that moment with that — that lifetime of experience. </p>

            the evidence is now clear that the majority of people coming across the <span class="keyword border">border</span> are not from Mexico. They're coming from Guatemala,
            El Salvador, Honduras. Those countries are the source of the people that are now coming
            in its majority. <span class="platform secure">I also believe
                we need a <span class="keyword wall">fence</span>. The problem is if El Chapo builds a tunnel under the <span class="keyword wall">fence</span>, we have
                to be able to deal with that too. And that's why you need an e-verify system and you need an entry-exit tracking system and all
                sorts of other things to prevent <span class="immigration">illegal immigration</span>.</span> But I
            agree with what Governor Kasich just said. People are frustrated. <span class="trope value">This is the most generous country in the world
                when it comes to <span class="immigration">immigration</span>. There are a million people a year who <span class="immigration">legally immigrate</span> to the United States, and people feel like we're being taken advantage of.
                We feel like despite our generosity, we're being taken advantage of.</span> And let
            me tell you who never gets talked about in these debates. The people that call my
            office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States. And they've
            paid their fees, and they hired a lawyer, and they can't get in. And they're wondering,
            maybe they should come illegally. [applause] And so these are important issues, and we
            should address it. It's a serious problem that needs to be addressed, and otherwise
            we're going to keep talking about this for the next 30 years, like we have for the last

            problems. We cannot deal with all three of these problems in one massive piece of

            our legal immigration system so you come to America on the basis of what you can

               <a href="debate_repub_2015-10-28.xhtml#speech239">[source] </a> Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they
            should never be able to use the program again. If you get caught abusing this program,
            you should never be able to use it again. The second thing I said is we need to add
            reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms. <span class="platform econ">For example, before you hire
            anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days. You also have to
            prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so
            that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.</span> But here's the best solution
            of all. We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the
            21st century. Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing
            vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can
            train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to
            go work. But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so
            Americans have the skills for those jobs. But in the interim, in the absence of that,
            what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those — those centers (ph)
            to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here. But the ideal
            scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from
            abroad.</p>

               <a href="debate_repub_2015-10-28.xhtml#speech333">[source] </a> Thank you. Well, I've learned the rules on this. [laughter] Look,
            in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legalimmigration system for permanent residents. Today, we have a legalimmigration system
            for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative
            living here. And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956. But in 2015, we have a
            very different economy. <span class="trope econ">Our legalimmigration system
                from now on has to be merit-based.</span>
               <span class="trope econ">It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically</span>, <span class="trope value">and
            most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not

                voted for it because they wanted to keep it alive and they were afraid the whole
                program would expire. Here's the world we live in. This is a radical jihadist group
                that is increasingly sophisticated in its ability, for example, to radicalize
                American citizens, in its inability to exploit loopholes in our legal immigration
                system, in its ability to capture and hold territory in the Middle East, as I
                outlined earlier, in multiple countries. This is not just the most capable, it is
                the most sophisticated terror threat we have ever faced. We are now at a time when
                we need more tools, not less tools. And that took we lost, the metadata program, was
                a valuable tool that we no longer have at our disposal.</p>

               <a href="debate_repub_2015-12-15.xhtml#speech252">[source] </a> Yeah. <span class="anecdote value">
                  <span class="immigration"> Immigration</span>
                    is not an issue that I read about in the newspaper or watch a documentary on PBS
                    or CNN. It's an issues I've lived around my whole life. My family are
                    immigrants. My wife's family are <span class="immigrant">immigrants</span>. All of my neighbors are <span class="immigrant">immigrants</span>.
                    I see every aspect of this problem. The good, the bad, and the ugly. And here's
                    what we learned in 2013. The American people don't trust the Federal Government
                    to enforce our immigration laws, and we will not be able to do anything on
                    immigration until we first prove to the American people that <span class="immigration">illegal immigration</span>
                    is under control. And we can do that. We know what it takes to do
                    that.</span> It takes at least 20,000 more additional <span class="keyword border">border</span> agents. It takes completing those 700 miles of fencing. It
                takes a mandatory e-verify system and a mandatory
                entry/exit tracking system to prevent overstays. After we have done that, the second
                thing we have to do is reform and modernize the legal immigration system.<span class="trope value"> And after we have done those two things, I
                    think the American people are gonna be reasonable with what do you do with
                    someone who has been in this country for 10 or 12 years who hasn't otherwise
                    violated our laws — because if they're a criminal they can't stay. They'll have
                    to undergo a background check, pay a fine, start paying taxes. And ultimately,
                    they'll given a work permit and that's all they're gonna be allowed to have for
                    at least 10 years.</span> But you can't get to that third step until you have
                done the other two things, and that was the lesson we learned in 2013. There is no
                trust that the Federal Government will enforce the law. They will not support you
                until you see it done first.</p>

               <a href="debate_repub_2015-12-15.xhtml#speech254">[source] </a> But I've answered that question repeatedly. I am personally
                open — after all that has happened and after ten years in that probationary status
                where all they have is a permit, I personally am open to allowing people to apply
                for a green card. That may not be a majority position in my party, but that's down
                the road. You can't even begin that process until you prove to people — not just
                pass a law that says you're gonna bring <span class="immigration">illegal immigration</span> under control.
                You're gonna have to do it and prove to people that it's working. And that was the
                lesson of 2013. And it's more true today, than it was then. After a migratory crisis
                on the <span class="keyword border">border</span> with minors coming over that you're
                seeing start up again now, after all these executive orders the President has
                issued. More than ever we need to...</p>

               <a href="debate_repub_2015-12-15.xhtml#speech260">[source] </a> Yeah, a couple points. In 2013 we had never faced a crisis like
                the <span class="immigrant">Syrian refugee</span>
                crisis now. Up until that point, a <span class="immigrant">refugee</span> meant someone fleeing oppression, fleeing Communism like it
                is in my community. As far as Ted's record, I'm always puzzled by his attack on this
                issue. Ted, you support legalizing people who are in this country illegally. Ted
                Cruz supported a 500-percent increase in the number of H-1 visas, the <span class="immigrant">guest workers</span> that are allowed
                into this country, and Ted supports doubling the number of green cards. So I think
                what's important for us to understand and there is a way forward on this issue that
                we can bring our country together on. And while I'm president I will do it. And it
                will begin by bringing <span class="immigration">illegal immigration</span> under control and proving to the American

                why those <span class="immigrant">refugees</span> were

                    that we may not be able to, because this is an issue we have to be 100 percent
                    right on. If we allow 9,999 Syrian refugees into the United States, and all of
                    them are good people, but we allow one person in who's an ISIS killer — we just
                    get one person wrong, we've got a serious problem.</span> And there is not a

               <a href="debate_repub_2016-01-14.xhtml#speech230">[source] </a>Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for
                30 years. And for 30 years, the issue of <span class="immigration">immigration</span> has been about someone who's in
                this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job. This
                issue is not about that anymore. <span class="trope secure">First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything
                    else about keeping America safe.</span> And here's why. There is a radical
                jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system. And not just green cards. They're looking —
                they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even
                fiances. They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern <span class="keyword border">border</span>. They're looking — they're looking to manipulate
                our — the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States. So our number
                one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United
                States. So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when
                I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going
                to get into the United States of America.</p>

               <a href="debate_repub_2016-01-14.xhtml#speech232">[source] </a>The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24
                months ago. Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of
                radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to
                enter our country legally. They have a sophisticated understanding of our
                    <span class="immigration">legal immigration
                    system</span> and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not
                able to use that system against us. The entire system of <span class="immigration">legal immigration</span> must now be reexamined
                for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS. Because they're recruiting
                people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as <span class="immigrant">refugees</span>. We know this for a fact.
                They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people
                in through the southern <span class="keyword border">border</span>. And they got a
                killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance. This issue now has to be about

               <a href="debate_repub_2016-01-14.xhtml#speech237">[source] </a>Maria, let me clear something up here. This is an interesting
                point when you talk about <span class="immigration">immigration</span>. Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the
                number of green cards, now you say that you're against it. You used to support a 500
                percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
                You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're
                against it. You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that
                you are against it. And by the way, it's not just on <span class="immigration">immigration</span>, you used to support TPA, now you
                say you're against it. I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop
                insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw
                you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason. [applause] That is not
                consistent conservatism, that is political calculation. When I am president, I will
                work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward
                Snowden, as you did, a great public servant. Edward Snowden is a traitor. And if I
                am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
                [applause] And one more point, one more point. Every single time that there has been
                a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it. Bernie
                Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for,
                Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about
                how it cuts defense. Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this. If I'm
                president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto
                that in a millisecond. [applause]</p>

                that this issue does need to be solved. They've been talking about this issue for 30
                years, and nothing ever happens. And, I'm going to tell you exactly how we're going

                cards, either. There will be a process. We will see what the American people are

                in place and that's working, I believe the American people will support a very

                are not dangerous criminals, who pay taxes and pay fines for what they did. But

And the approach that was tried and has been tried now repeatedly over ten years to do this comprehensively, all at once in a massive piece of legislation has no chance of passage.
It is not leadership to continue to try something that has no chance of happening. I want to make progress on this issue. It has been discussed now for 30 years and nothing ever happens.
And I am telling you that the only way forward on this issue that has any chance of happening, meaning gaining the support of the American people, you cannot do this without the support of the American people, is an approach that begins by proving that once and for all, <span class="immigration">illegal immigration</span> is under control.</p>

               <a href="debate_repub_2016-02-13.xhtml#speech162">[source] </a>Well, first of all, I think <span class="keyword amnesty">amnesty</span> is the forgiveness of a wrongdoing without consequence and that —
            I've never supported that. I do not support that. I think there has to be consequences
            for violating our immigration laws. What I
            think is clear about this issue to begin with is we're not going to be able to make
            progress on <span class="immigration">illegal
                immigration</span> until first, <span class="immigration">illegal immigration</span> is brought under
            control. You go back to 1986, when they legalized three million <span class="immigrant">people</span> and they promised to secure the
                <span class="keyword border">border</span>. It didn't happen, and as a result, people
            have lost trust in the federal government. It is now clear that the only way to make
            progress on <span class="immigration">immigration</span> is
            not just to pass a law that enforces the law, but actually prove to people that it's
            working. They want to see the <span class="keyword wall">wall</span> built. They want to
            see the additional border agents. They want to
            see E-Verify. They want to see an entry-exit tracking
            system. Forty percent of the <span class="immigrant">people in this
                country illegally</span> are entering legally and <span class="keyword visa_overstay">overstaying visas</span>. And only after all of that is in place, then we'll see
            what the American people are willing to support on this issue. I think the American
            people will be very reasonable, but responsible, about how you handle someone who has
            been here a long time, who can pass a background check, who pays a fine and starts
            paying taxes and all they want is a work permit. But you can't do any of that until you

            wasn't telling the truth then or he isn't telling the truth now, but to argue he is a

                But the only way forward on this issue — you asked a question about flexibility. Let

                You will not pass comprehensive immigration

They are just coming in primarily based on family connection. And let me tell you, when my parents came in 1956, I acknowledge that my parents came to the U.S. on a family-based system.
The problem is nothing looks like it did 60 years ago. The 21st Century economy simply is not creating enough jobs for people that don't have skills. <span class="anecdote value">When my parents came, they had a very limited education. My father stopped going to school when he was 9 years old because his mother died and he had to work. And he would work the next 70 years of his life and never go back to school. And I'm grateful every day that America welcomed them.</span>
But today in the 21st Century, 60 years later, finding jobs when you don't have skills is very difficult. We need to move to a merit- based system of immigration, not just on H-1B, particularly on green cards. The primary criteria for bringing someone from abroad in the 21st Century should be, what skills do you have? What business are you going to open? What investment are you going to make? What job are you going to be able to do when you arrive in the United States? [applause]

                cards, either. There will be a process. We will see what the American people are

            president Obama very easy. He failed miserably, and it was an embarrassment to
            everybody, including the Republican party. It looked like he went away on a vacation the
            last month. So, I don't take that, and I guess, obviously, he wants to be relevant. He
            wants to be back in the game. As far as domestic policy and trade which is killing our
            country, he said free trade and I believe in free trade also. But, if you look at China,
            and you look Japan, and if you look at Mexico, both at the <span class="keyword border">border</span>, by the way, where
            they're killing us. Both at the <span class="keyword border">border</span>, and with trade — and every other country we do
            business with we are getting absolutely crushed on trade. And, he said free trade, I say
            free trade great. But, not when they're beating us so badly. With China we're going to
            lose $505 billion dollars in terms of trades. You just can't do it. Mexico, $58 billion
            dollars. Japan, probably about, they don't know it yet, but about $109 billion dollars.
            Every country we lose money with. As far as I'm concerned, we've got to reduce — we have
            to redo our trade deals 100 percent. I have the greatest business people in the world
            lined up to do it. We will make...[bell ringing]... great trade deals. [cheering] </p>

            First of all, Buzzfeed? They were the ones that said under no circumstances will I run
            for president. And were they wrong. But a lot of people said that. Then, I did have a
            meeting with the editorial board of the New York Times, a very nice meeting. Many of
            those things were off the record, I think at their suggestion and my suggestion. And I
            think being off the record is a very important thing. I think it's a very, very powerful
            thing. And I will say this. These three gentlemen have gone off the record many times
            with reporters. And I think they want to honor it, and I would always honor that. I will
            say, though, in terms of <span class="immigration">immigration</span> — and almost anything else — there always has to be
            some, you know, tug and pull and deal. And, you know, when I watch Ted stand on the
            Senate floor, I had great respect for what he did. He stood there for a day-and-a- half
            or something. In the meantime, what came of it? Nothing. You have to be able to have
            some flexibility, some negotiation. Now, sometimes you ask for more than you want and
            you negotiate down to the point. I may have discussed something like that with the New
            York Times, but I would never release off-the-record conversations. I don't think it's

And I will tell you, we are a country of laws. We need borders. We will have a wall. The wall will be built. The wall will be successful. And if you think walls don't work, all you have to do is ask Israel. The wall works, believe me. Properly done. Believe me. [cheering and applause]

               <a href="debate_gen_2016-10-09.xhtml#speech5">[source] </a> Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. I've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I've been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.

And my whole concept was to make America great again. When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.

When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it's in business and trade, where we're doing so badly. Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. It's hard to believe. Inconceivable.

You say who's making these deals? We're going the make great deals. We're going to have a <span class="keyword border">strong border</span>. We're going to bring back law and order. Just today, policemen was shot, two killed. And this is happening on a weekly basis. We have to bring back respect to law enforcement. At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. We need justice.

But I want to do things that haven't been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it. It's called make America great again.

We're going to make America safe again. We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again. And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just—it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.

When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don't want them. In some cases, they're murderers, drug lords, drug problems. And they don't want them.

And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that's OK, we can't force it into their country. Let me tell you, I'm going to force them right back into their country. They're murderers and some very bad people.

And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment,<span class="trope secure"> because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you've never seen.</span>

            they have—it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems
            caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama.    All of the problems—the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border.   It's just pouring and destroying their youth.    It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other
            people.  We have to have strong borders.    We have to keep the drugs out of our country.    We
