            [CLINTON]  Thank you very much. I've been looking forward to this
                debate, and I want to thank Univision, the Washington Post, Facebook and Miami-Dade
                College, the largest college in North America for hosting us here this evening.
                [applause] And tonight I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how we
                knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying
                ahead, starting with the economic ones. My focus is on more good paying jobs with
                rising incomes for families and how we prevent corporations from taking jobs out of
                our country by imposing an exit tax, making them pay back any tax breaks they've
                gotten. But we also need to be having a positive agenda for manufacturing. for small
                businesses and entrepreneurs, for more clean energy jobs. And I also look forward to
                discussing comprehensive immigration
                    reform with a <span class="keyword path_to_citizenship">path to
                    citizenship</span> that will be one of my priorities in my first 100 days as
                president. And I will also be talking about education, every child deserves a good
                teacher and a good school. </p>
               <p id="speech10">
            [SALINAS]  Thank you, Secretary. </p>

               <p id="speech13">
            [SANDERS]  Thank you — thank you all very much. I'm running for
                president of the United States because given the crises facing our country, it is
                just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. Together we're
                going to have to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision.
                [applause] Billionaires and Wall Street should not be buying elections. We've got to
                end this rigged economy where people are working longer hours for low wages, almost
                all new income and wealth going to the top 1 percent, and of course, <span class="platform value">we need comprehensive
                        immigration reform and a

                as much as any city in America, we know that we have got to combat climate change,
                transform our energy system, and leave this planet in a way that is healthy and
                habitable for our kids and our grandchildren. </p>

               <p id="speech14">
            [SALINAS]  Thank you, Senator. First question, Secretary, you have been
                starting to sound like the nominee lately, but many voters are saying, not so fast.
                Where did you fail last night in Michigan? </p>
               <p id="speech15">
            [CLINTON]  Well, look, I won one of the contests and lost another close
                one. I am continuing to work hard for every single vote across our country. I was
                pleased that I got 100,000 more votes last night than my opponent and more
                delegates. So this is a marathon, and it's a marathon that can only be carried out
                by the kind of inclusive campaign that I'm running, a campaign that reaches out to
                everybody, a campaign that offers real positive solutions to the problems that we
                face, a campaign that is based on how together we can make progress, because I am a
                progressive who likes to get things done. So I'm excited about the upcoming
                contests, including right here in Florida. And we'll continue to work as hard as I
                can to earn the vote of every single voter. </p>
               <p id="speech16">
            [SALINAS]  What went wrong in Michigan? [applause] What went wrong in
                Michigan? What went wrong in Michigan? What failed in Michigan specifically? </p>
               <p id="speech17">
            [CLINTON]  It was a very close race. We've had some of those. I've won
                some. I've lost some. But, you know, I was very pleased by the overall outcome last
                night. And now we're on to the states for next Tuesday and I'm looking forward to
                campaigning hard in all of them. </p>
               <p id="speech18">
            [SALINAS]  Senator, aside from your astounding upset last night in
                Michigan, you are still far behind Secretary Clinton in delegate count. She has
                1,221 delegates, including superdelegates, and you have 571. What is your pathway to
                make up the deficit, and can you realistically catch up? </p>
               <p id="speech19">
            [SANDERS]  Well, you know, when we began this campaign, I was 3% in the
                polls. I was probably 60 or 70 points behind the Secretary. We have come a long way
                in 10 months. We have won...[applause]...including Michigan last night, which some
                people,considered one of the major political upsets in modern American history. We
                have won nine state primaries and caucuses. And I believe that our message of the
                need for people to stand up and tell corporate America and Wall Street that they
                cannot have it all is resonating across this country. And I think in the coming
                weeks and months, we are going to continue to do extremely well, win a number of
                these primaries, and convince superdelegates that Bernie Sanders is the strongest
                candidate to defeat Donald Trump. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech20">
            [RAMOS]  Secretary Clinton, I want to disclose once again that my
                daughter Paula works for your campaign. And now I have a question about your emails.
                Your Republican opponents say that those emails have endangered our national
                security. When you were secretary of state, you wrote 104 emails in your private
                server that the government now says contain classified information according to The
                Washington Post analysis. That goes against a memo that you personally sent to your
                employees in 2011 directing all of them to use official email, precisely because of
                security concerns. So it seems that you issued one set of rules for yourself and a
                different set of rules for the rest of the State Department. So who specifically
                gave you permission to operate your email system as you did? Was it President Barack
                Obama? And would you drop out of the race if you get indicted? </p>
               <p id="speech21">
            [CLINTON]  Well, Jorge, there's a lot of questions in there. And I'm
                going to give the same answer I've been giving for many months. It wasn't the best
                choice. I made a mistake. It was not prohibited. It was not in any way disallowed.
                And as I have said and as now has come out, my predecessors did the same thing and
                many other people in the government. But here's the cut to the chase facts. I did
                not send or receive any emails marked classified at the time. What you are talking
                about is retroactive classification. And the reason that happens is when somebody
                asks or when you are asked to make information public, I asked all my emails to be
                made public. Then all the rest of the government gets to weigh in. And some other
                parts of the government, we're not exactly sure who, has concluded that some of the
                emails should be now retroactively classified. They've just said the same thing to
                former Secretary Colin Powell. They have said, we're going to retroactively classify
                emails you sent personally. Now I think he was right when he said this is an
                absurdity. And I think that what we have got here is a case of overclassification. </p>
               <p id="speech22">
            [RAMOS]  If we get your permission... </p>
               <p id="speech23">
            [CLINTON]  I am not concerned about it. I am not worried about it and no
                Democrat or American should be either. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech24">
            [RAMOS]  Secretary Clinton, the questions were, who gave you permission
                to cooperate? Was it President Obama? </p>
               <p id="speech25">
            [CLINTON]  There was no permission to be asked. It had been done by my
                predecessors. It was permitted. </p>
               <p id="speech26">
            [RAMOS]  If you get indicted would you going to drop out? </p>
               <p id="speech27">
            [CLINTON]  Oh, for goodness — that's not going to happen. I'm not even
                answering that question. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech28">
            [RAMOS]  Senator Sanders, you have gone from saying the following, the
                American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e- mails, to claiming
                that it is a very serious issue. Which is it? </p>
               <p id="speech29">
            [SANDERS]  There is a process under way, and that process will take its
                course. Today in America, the middle class is disappearing. We have massive levels
                of income and wealth inequality, climate change threatens the whole planet, 47
                million people live in poverty. I'm going to focus on the issues facing the working
                families of this country. That process specifically. </p>
               <p id="speech30">
            [TUMULTY]  Secretary Clinton, you have known Donald Trump a long time.
                You have seen what kind of campaign he's running. Secretary Clinton, is Donald Trump
                a racist? </p>
               <p id="speech31">
            [CLINTON]  Karen, I'm going to follow my friend Senator Sanders model
                here. If I'm so fortunate enough to be the Democratic nominee, there will be a lot
                of time to talk about him. I was the first one to call him out. I called him out
                when he was calling Mexicans rapists. When he was engaging in rhetoric that I found
                deeply offensive. I said basta, and I am pleased that others...[applause]...others
                are also joining in making clear that his rhetoric, his demagoguery, his trafficking
                in prejudice and paranoia has no place in our political system. Especially from
                somebody running for president who couldn't decide whether or not to disavow the Ku
                Klux Klan and David Duke. So people can draw their own conclusions about him. I will
                just end by saying this. You don't make America great by getting rid of everything
                that made America great. [applause] </p>

            <div class="imm">
               <p id="speech32">
            [TUMULTY]  Secretary Clinton, my question was about his character. And
                that is one of the primary things that Americans think about when they choose their
                next president. How would you describe the character of a person who has said the
                sorts of things he has about <span class="immigrant">Mexican immigrants</span>, about women, and who would ban people from
                entering this country based on their religion? </p>
               <p id="speech33">
            [CLINTON]  I think it's un-American. I think what he has promoted is not
                at all in keeping with American values, Karen. And I am going to take every
                opportunity to criticize him, to raise those issues. I'm not going to engage in the
                kind of language that he uses. I think we can make the case against him if he is the
                nominee, by pointing out what he has said. What he claims to believe in The values
                he's promoting and I think that's a better way for the American people to draw their
                conclusions. </p>
               <p id="speech34">
            [TUMULTY]  Senator Sanders, do you think it's fair to call Donald Trump
                a racist? </p>
               <p id="speech35">
            [SANDERS]  This is what I think. I think that the American people are
                never going to elect a president who insults Mexicans, who insults Muslims, who
                insults women, who insults African-Americans. And let us not forget that several
                years ago, Trump was in the middle of the so- called birther movement, trying to
                delegitimize the president of the United States of America. [applause] You know, I
                find it very interesting, Karen, my dad was born in Poland. I know a little bit
                about the <span class="immigrant">immigrant
                    experience</span>. Nobody has ever asked me for my birth certificate. Maybe
                it has something to do with the color of my skin. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech36">
            [TUMULTY]  So what does that tell you about his character? </p>
               <p id="speech37">
            [SANDERS]  And I am very pleased — I am very pleased that I think in the
                last national poll that I saw, we were running 18 points ahead of Donald Trump.
                [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech38">
            [RAMOS]  On [inaudible], people are talking about <span class="immigration">immigration</span>, and this map shows
                where in the country they are talking about it the most. Maria Elena? </p>
               <p id="speech39">
            [SALINAS]  So Secretary, I have a question for you. In 2003, you said on
                a radio show, specifically it was John Gambling's radio show in New York, that you
                were adamantly against <span class="immigrant">illegal
                    immigrants</span> and that people have to stop employing <span class="immigrant">illegal immigrants</span>.
                    <span class="trope value">Your new
                        <span class="immigration">immigration</span>
                    plan is that you would expand President Obama's executive actions and that you
                    would push for legislation that would include a <span class="keyword path_to_citizenship">path to citizenship</span> for undocumented immigrants.</span>
                So, are you flip-flopping on this issue? Or are you pandering to Latinos, what some
                would call Hispandering? [laughter] </p>
               <p id="speech40">
            [CLINTON]  In 2003, I sponsored the DREAMER Act. I sponsored I think in
                every Congress after that. I have been consistent and committed to <span class="trope value">comprehensive immigration reform with a
                        <span class="keyword path_to_citizenship">path to citizenship</span>.</span> I
                think our best chance was in 2007, when Ted Kennedy led the charge on comprehensive immigration reform. We have
                Republican support. We had a president willing to sign it. I voted for that bill.
                Senator Sanders voted against it. Just think, imagine where we would be today is we
                had achieved comprehensive immigration
                    reform nine years ago. Imagine how much more secure families would be
                in our country, no longer fearing the deportation of a loved one; no longer fearing
                that they would be found out. So I am staunchly in favor of comprehensive immigration reform and have
                been so over the course of my public career. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech41">
            [SALINAS]  Now, Senator Sanders, in 2007, you voted against immigration reform. You now say that it was
                because the bill had guestworker provisions which seemed semi-slavery. But back
                then, this is what you said to CNN's Lou Dobbs. Let's listen. [begin video clip] </p>
               <p id="speech42">
            [SANDERS]  Poverty is increasing. And if wages are going down, I don't
                know why we need millions of people to be coming into this country as guestworkers
                who will work for lower wages than American workers and drive wages down even lower
                than they are right now. [end video clip] [crosstalk] </p>
               <p id="speech43">
            [SALINAS]  So, Senator, were you concerned with working conditions for
                guestworkers, or really because you think <span class="immigrant">immigrants</span> drive down wages and take jobs from
                Americans? </p>
               <p id="speech44">
            [SANDERS]  Well, you have guestworker programs that have been described
                by the Southern Poverty Law Center, one of the important institutions in this
                country who studies these issues, as guestworkers programs akin to slavery, where
                people came in. They were cheated. They were abused. They were humiliated. And if
                they stood up for their rights, they would be thrown out of the country. Of course,
                that type of [inaudible] leads to a race to the bottom for all of our people. And I
                worked very hard on that issue. And of course, I supported the 2013 immigration reform bill. And what I believe
                right now is not only that we need comprehensive
                    immigration reform, if the Congress does not do its job, as president
                of the United States I will use the executive powers of that office to do what has
                to be done, to do what President Obama did, and expand on that. </p>
               <p id="speech45">
            [SALINAS]  But if you're saying that you would...[applause]...if you're
                saying that you would expand on the executive actions, how do you that they're not
                going to end up in a legal battle just like Obama's executive actions? </p>
               <p id="speech46">
            [SANDERS]  Well, we do the best — we don't know. And I should also say
                with regard to that 2007 immigration bill, as you may know, LULAC, the major
                Hispanic organization in his country, also opposed that bill as did many other
                Latino organizations. But to your point, we have to do the best we can. I applaud
                President Obama for his efforts on DAPA and DACA. And I think we have got to expand
                those efforts. </p>
               <p id="speech47">
            [CLINTON]  If I could...[applause] You know, I think it's very hard to
                make the case that Ted Kennedy, Barack Obama, me, La Raza, United Farmworkers,
                Dolores Huerta, leaders of the Latino community, would have supported a bill that
                actually promoted modern slavery. That was one of the many excuses used not to vote
                for the 2007 bill. And I will go back to what I said. If we had been able to get
                that passed, we would be so much further along now. I'm committed to defending DAPA
                and DACA. I'm committed to going even further to get more people deferred action, to
                go as far as I can under the law. And I am committed to introducing comprehensive immigration reform with a
                    <span class="keyword path_to_citizenship">path to citizenship</span> in the first
                100 days of my presidency. </p>
               <p id="speech48">
            [SALINAS]  Secretary Sanders (sic). Senator, would you like to respond? </p>
               <p id="speech49">
            [SANDERS]  Well, when we talk about efforts to assist <span class="immigrant">immigrants</span>, Secretary Clinton
                prevailed upon the governor of New York, Elliot Spitzer, who wanted to do the right
                thing and provide driver's license to <span class="immigrant">these who were undocumented</span>, she
                said don't do it, and New York State still does not do it. In Vermont, by the way, I
                worked with officials and <span class="immigrant">undocumented people</span> in Vermont do have the ability to get driver's
                license. [applause] When we talk about <span class="immigration">immigration</span>, the secretary will remember that
                one of the great tragedies, human tragedies of recent years is children came from
                Honduras where there's probably more violence than almost any place in this country,
                and they came into this country. And I said welcome those children into this
                country, Secretary Clinton said send them back. That's a difference. </p>
               <p id="speech50">
            [CLINTON]  Let me — let me respond again because the misrepresentation
                can't go unanswered here. First of all, that is something that is not fair about
                what I said. I did say we needed to be very concerned about little children coming
                to this country — on their own, very often — many of them not making it. And when
                they got here, they needed, as I have argued for, legal counsel, due process, to
                make a decision. We need to end private detention, we need to end family detention.
                And in 2006, when Senator Sanders was running for the Senate from Vermont, he voted
                in the House with hard-line Republicans for indefinite detention for <span class="immigrant">undocumented
                    immigrants</span>, and then he sided with those Republicans to stand with
                vigilantes known as Minute Men who were taking up outposts along the border to hunt
                down <span class="immigrant">immigrants</span>. So I think
                when you were running for the Senate, you made it clear by your vote, Senator, that
                you were going to stand with the Republicans. When you got to the Senate in 2007,
                one of the first things you did was vote against Ted Kennedy's immigration reform which he'd been working
                on for years before you ever arrived. </p>
               <p id="speech51">
            [SALINAS]  One last response. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech52">
            [SANDERS]  Let me respond — let me respond to that. </p>
               <p id="speech53">
            [SALINAS]  Go ahead. </p>
               <p id="speech54">
            [SANDERS]  You know, Ted Kennedy was a very close friend of mine, and I
                served on the committee he chaired, the Health, Education, Labor Committee. And Ted
                Kennedy was kind enough to allow me to hold a hearing in 2008, I believe, in
                Congress, dealing with the plight of <span class="immigrant">undocumented tomato pickers</span> in
                Immokalee, Florida. [applause] And I went there on my own. Wasn't an issue really
                for the state of Vermont to expose the horrendous working conditions and the semi
                slavery, if you like, that <span class="immigrant">those
                    workers</span> lived under. And the result of that hearing and the work
                that many, many people did was to significantly improve the wages and working
                conditions of <span class="immigrant">those
                    workers</span>. [applause] </p>

               <p id="speech63">
            [CLINTON]  Let me say this. I would give every person, but particularly
                children, due process to have their story told. And a lot of children will, of
                course, have very legitimate stories under our law to be able to stay. [end video
                clip] </p>
               <p id="speech64">
            [RAMOS]  So secretary, you seem to be defending President Obama's
                deportation policy. And as you know, so far he has deported more than 2.5 million
                    <span class="immigrant">immigrants</span>. So if you
                really don't want to be the next deporter in chief, can you promise tonight that you
                won't deport children and that you won't deport <span class="immigrant">immigrants</span> who don't have a criminal record and
                this time, could I get a yes or no answer? </p>
               <p id="speech65">
            [CLINTON]  Yes, you can because the question you were asking me were
                about children seeking asylum. And we have laws. That was the most critical thing I
                said. Under our laws. I would like to see those laws changed. I would like see added
                to them, a guaranteed counsel and other support for <span class="immigrant">children</span>. But if you are asking about everyone who
                is already here, <span class="immigrant">undocumented immigrants</span>, the 11-12 million who are living here, my
                priorities are to deport violent criminals, terrorists, and anyone who threatens our
                safety. So I do not have the same policy as the current administration does. I think
                it's important that we move to our comprehensive
                    immigration reform, but at the same time, stop the raids, stop the
                round-ups, stop the deporting of people who are living here doing their lives, doing
                their jobs, and that's my priority. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech66">
            [RAMOS]  But again, yes or no, can you promise tonight that you won't

               <p id="speech67">
            [CLINTON]  I will not deport <span class="immigrant">children</span>. I would not deport <span class="immigrant">children</span>. I do not want to deport <span class="immigrant">family members</span> either, Jorge. I
                want to, as I said, prioritize who would be deported: violent criminals, people
                planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us. That's a relatively small
                universe. </p>
               <p id="speech68">
            [RAMOS]  OK. So I want to be very specific. So you are telling us
                tonight that if you become president you won't deport <span class="immigrant">children</span> who are already here? </p>
               <p id="speech69">
            [CLINTON]  I will not. </p>
               <p id="speech70">
            [RAMOS]  And that you won't deport <span class="immigrant">immigrants</span> who don't have a criminal record? </p>
               <p id="speech71">
            [CLINTON]  That's what I'm telling you. Now I don't want — because I'm
                not contradicting what I told you in the interview. <span class="keyword asylum">Asylum</span> is a particular legal process. I'd like to see it changed. I'd
                like to see us give more support to people who come fleeing the terrible violence
                that they do. But under our law, we have a process we have to go [through which is
                different. </p>
               <p id="speech72">
            [RAMOS]  So you will stop those deportations. </p>
               <p id="speech73">
            [CLINTON]  I would stop... </p>
               <p id="speech74">

               <p id="speech76">
            [RAMOS]  ... and those who don't have a criminal record. </p>
               <p id="speech77">
            [CLINTON]  Of the people, the <span class="immigrant">undocumented people</span> living in our
                country, I do not want to see them deported. I want to see them on a <span class="keyword path_to_citizenship">path to citizenship</span>. That is exactly what I
                will do. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech78">
            [RAMOS]  Senator Sanders, would you — can you promise us tonight that
                you won't deport children? </p>
               <p id="speech79">
            [SANDERS]  Let me just say this. I don't think that the secretary fully
                answered your question, and I think the proof may be in the pudding. Honduras and
                that region of the world may be the most violent region in our hemisphere. Gang
                lords, vicious people torturing people, doing horrible things to families. Children
                fled that part of the world to try, try, try, try, maybe, to meet up with their
                family members in this country, taking a route that was horrific, trying to start a
                new life. Secretary Clinton did not support those children coming into this country.
                I did. Now I happen to agree with President Obama on many, many issues. I think he
                has done a great job as president of the United States. He is wrong on this issue of
                deportation. I disagree with him on that. [applause] So to answer your question, no,
                I will not deport <span class="immigrant">children</span>
                from the United States of America. </p>
               <p id="speech80">
            [RAMOS]  And can you promise not to deport <span class="immigrant">immigrants</span> who don't have a criminal record? </p>
               <p id="speech81">
            [SANDERS]  I can make that promise. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech82">
            [CLINTON]  This is why I go back to that 2007 vote because if we had
                been successful then, a lot of the issues we are still discussing today would be in
                the rear-view mirror. I want us to be able to achieve comprehensive immigration reform if I'm so
                fortunate enough to be president. And we do have to take a look at asylum laws. When
                I was secretary of state, I worked to try to support many different approaches to
                ending the violence in Central America. I was there meeting with leaders, security
                leaders, and others. And I think the Congress should support the president's request
                to fund programs that would protect people and change the culture of criminality and
                violence in Central America, helping people be able to stay safely in their homes
                and countries. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech83">
            [SANDERS]  Let me just answer, I want to get back to this 2007 immigration bill. It's true, Ted Kennedy, a
                good friend of mine, and I think of the secretary's, did work very hard on that
                bill. But does anyone really believe that if that bill was all so good, as the
                secretary is touting, that LULAC and other major Latino organizations, the largest
                Latino organizations in this country said no to that bill. And I worked very hard in
                improving the guest worker provisions so that in 2013 a bill I strongly supported,
                people who were in the guest worker program in America would not be treated like
                slaves. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech84">
            [CLINTON]  Let me just conclude by saying that United Farm Workers
                considered that bill in their words the last best hope for farm workers and
                    <span class="immigrant">immigrants</span>. They have
                proven to be right in the succeeding years. I only hope that we can put together a
                coalition to pass comprehensive immigration
                    reform in the next Congress. And as I said earlier, in 2006, Senator
                Sanders supported indefinite detention for people facing deportation... </p>
               <p id="speech85">
            [SANDERS]  It's... </p>
               <p id="speech86">
            [CLINTON]  ...and stood with the Minutemen vigilantes in their
                ridiculous, absurd efforts to, quote, "hunt down <span class="immigrant">immigrants</span>. So look, I think the goal here is to
                elect a Democratic Senate, elect a Democratic president and get to work immediately
                to get comprehensive immigration
                reform. [applause] </p>

            [RAMOS]  Did you support the Minutemen, as Secretary Clinton has said? </p>
               <p id="speech90">
            [SANDERS]  Of course not. There was a piece of legislation supported by
                dozens and dozens of members of the House which codified existing legislation. What
                the secretary is doing tonight and has done very often is take large pieces of
                legislation and take pieces out of it. No, I did not oppose the bailout or the
                support of the automobile industry. No, I do not support vigilantes, and that is a
                horrific statement, an unfair statement to make. [applause] I will stand [inaudible]
                of my career, political career fighting for workers, fighting for the poorest people
                in this country. Madame Secretary, I will match my record against yours any day of
                the week. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech91">
            [CLINTON]  Well, let's do that. Let's talk about that. Let's talk about
                that. </p>
               <p id="speech92">
            [RAMOS]  Secretary, you said this morning... </p>
               <p id="speech93">
            [CLINTON]  Let's talk about the auto bailout because I think it's
                important for people to understand what happened. In December of 2008, we were both
                in the Senate, there was a vote on a free-standing bill to rescue the auto industry.
                We both voted for it. was the right vote. Unfortunately, it did not succeed. The
                Republicans marshalled the votes against it. A month later, in January, a new piece
                of legislation was offered that contained the money that would be used for the auto
                rescue. Then President-elect Obama — before he'd even been sworn in — sent word to
                all of us that he really hoped we would support it. He was still in the Senate, I
                was still in the Senate. And I voted for it. It was a hard vote. I'll tell you, it
                was a hard vote. A lot of the votes you make are hard votes. But the fact is the
                money that rescued the auto industry was in that bill. </p>
               <p id="speech94">
            [SALINAS]  Secretary... </p>
               <p id="speech95">
            [CLINTON]  Now, Senator Sanders voted against it. That's his perfect
                right to vote against it. But if everyone had voted as he voted... </p>
               <p id="speech96">
            [RAMOS]  OK, Senator. </p>
               <p id="speech97">
            [SANDERS]  Yeah, let me... </p>
               <p id="speech98">
            [CLINTON]  ... we would not have rescued the auto industry. </p>
               <p id="speech99">
            [RAMOS]  You have 30 seconds and then we'll pass to another. Thirty more
                seconds and then we'll move to another...[applause] </p>
               <p id="speech100">
            [SANDERS]  Let me — let's — so that everybody knows, the bill that
                Secretary Clinton is talking about, that is — that was the bailout of the
                recklessness, irresponsibility and illegal behavior of Wall Street. It was the Wall
                Street bailout. [applause] And I find it interesting that when Secretary Clinton,
                who was the former senator of New York, of course, when she defended her vote, she
                said, well, it's going to help the big banks in New York. Those are my constituents.
                And then you go to Detroit and suddenly this legislation helps the automobile
                workers. There was an article just yesterday... </p>

            [SALINAS]  We have to move on. Senator, the time is up. We have to move
                on. [applause] Next question. Secretary Clinton, you recently said instead of
                building walls we need to tear down barriers. However, last November in New
                Hampshire, you openly said that as senator you voted numerous times to build
                    <span class="keyword wall">the wall</span> with Mexico. What's the difference
                between what you did, voting to build <span class="keyword wall">the wall</span>, and
                what Donald Trump wants to do now? </p>
               <p id="speech107">
            [CLINTON]  Well, I think both of us, both Senator Sanders and I, voted
                numerous times to enhance <span class="keyword border">border security</span> along our
                    <span class="keyword border">border</span>. We increased the number of <span class="keyword border"> border security agents</span>. We did vote for money to build
                a <span class="keyword wall">fence</span>, a <span class="keyword wall">pedestrian
                    fence</span> in some place, a <span class="keyword wall">vehicle fence</span> in
                other places. And the result is that we have the most secure border we've ever had.
                Apprehensions coming across <span class="keyword border">the border</span> are the
                lowest they've been in 40 years, which just strengthens my argument that now it's
                time to do comprehensive immigration
                    reform. The Republicans, the opponents no longer have an argument. And
                certainly, we hear a lot coming from the Republican side that is absolutely out of
                touch with reality. We raised money [through the congressional appropriations
                process. We enhanced the <span class="keyword border">border security</span>. That part
                of the work is done. Everybody that I know has looked at it said, okay, we have a
                secure <span class="keyword border">border</span>. There's no need for this rhetoric
                and demagoguery that's still —is carried out on the Republican side. You've run out
                of excuses. Let's move to comprehensive
                    immigration reform with a <span class="keyword path_to_citizenship">path to
                    citizenship</span>. And I think that makes a very strong argument in favor of
                doing it. </p>
               <p id="speech108">
            [SALINAS]  But the question is, what is the difference between <span class="keyword wall">the wall</span> that you voted for and Donald Trump's wall? </p>
               <p id="speech109">
            [CLINTON]  It's a big difference. First of all, as I understand him,
                he's talking about <span class="keyword wall">a very tall wall</span>. [laughter]
                Right? <span class="keyword wall">A beautiful tall wall</span>. <span class="keyword wall">The most beautiful tall wall</span>, better than the Great Wall of China,
                that would run the entire border. That he would somehow magically get the Mexican
                government to pay for. And, you know, it's just fantasy. And in fact, if he cared to
                know anything about what members of Congress, like the senator and I have done,
                where it was necessary, we did support <span class="keyword wall">some fencing</span>.
                Where it was necessary, we did add border patrol agents. We have done what by any
                fair estimate would have to conclude is a good job, quote, "securing the border". So
                let's get about the business of comprehensive
                    immigration reform. </p>
               <p id="speech110">
            [SANDERS]  Let me just say... </p>
               <p id="speech111">
            [SALINAS]  Senator... </p>
               <p id="speech112">
            [SANDERS]  I think the secretary and I mostly, I think, agree on this
                issue. Look, in this country, immigration
                    reform is a very hot debate. It's divided the country. But I would
                hope very much, that as we have that debate, we do not, as Donald Trump and others
                have done, resort to racism and xenophobia and bigotry. [applause] This idea of
                suddenly, one day or maybe a night, rounding up 11 million <span class="immigrant">people</span> and taking them outside of
                this country is a vulgar, absurd idea that I would hope very few people in America
                support. </p>

            [TUMULTY]  Your time is up, senator. Thank you. </p>
               <p id="speech114">
            [SALINAS]  Now we have a question from the audience for both of you. </p>
               <p id="speech115">
            [QUESTION] [through translator]: We have a question from the public. I
                want to go to Lucia Aquiette. She's an <span class="immigrant">immigrant</span> from Guatemala, she's here with her five children who
                have not seen their father since he was deported three years ago. She has a question
                for both of you. </p>
               <p id="speech116">
            [QUESTION] [through translator]: I would like to ask — me and my
                children — hardworking men in the field — [inaudible]. </p>
               <p id="speech117">
            [QUESTION]  Senator Sanders, as you can see, these are a very painful
                and personal issue for Lucia and her family. She wants to know what you would do to
                stop deportations, but most importantly, to reunite families like hers. </p>
               <p id="speech118">
            [SANDERS]  Well, I absolutely support that. At the heart of my immigration policy and I should say that the
                New York times editorial board called my immigration policy the most progressive and the strongest of any
                candidate running. But to answer your question, the essence of what we are trying to
                do is to unite families, not to divide families. [applause] The idea that a mother
                is living here and her children are on the other side of the border is wrong and
                immoral. A number of months ago, I talked to a young man who was serving in the
                United States military and while he was serving in the military, his wife was
                deported. That is beyond comprehension and policies that should not be allowed to
                exist. So, ma'am, I will do everything that I can to unite your family. Your
                children deserve to be with their mother. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech119">
            [RAMOS]  Thank you Senator Sanders. </p>
               <p id="speech120">
            [QUESTION] [through translator]: Secretary Clinton, you've also said you
                want to stop deportations. But what's your plan to reunite families and thousands of
                children, U.S. citizens, with their parents? </p>
               <p id="speech121">
            [CLINTON]  First of all, please know how brave I think you are, coming
                here with your children to tell your story. This is an incredible act of courage
                that I'm not sure many people really understand. And I want you to know that in the
                work that I've done and the many families that I've met, I have heard similar
                stories like yours, where your husband is deported. Your children's father is gone.
                You are doing your very best to support your children. But it is time to bring
                families together. And I don't think there's any doubt that we must do more to let
                stories like yours be heard more widely so that more Americans know what the human
                cost of these policies are. And I will do everything I can to prevent other families
                from facing what you are facing. And I will do everything I can to pass laws that
                would bring families back together. And I hope that your children are all either
                citizens born in this country or eligible for the programs that President Obama has
                put into place, DACA and DAPA, because I will defend those and I will absolutely
                protect your children, yourself, and try to bring your family back together.

               <p id="speech123">
            [TUMULTY]  Thank you, Enrique. Secretary Clinton, a Washington Post poll
                just yesterday found that only 37 percent of Americans consider you honest and
                trustworthy. Now, when you've been asked about this in the past, you have said that
                this is the result of many, many years of Republican attacks upon you. But Americans
                have also had 25 — more than that — years to get to know you for themselves. Is
                there anything in your own actions and the decisions that you yourself have made
                that would foster this kind of mistrust? </p>
               <p id="speech124">
            [CLINTON]  Well, first Karen, obviously it's painful for me to hear
                that. And I do take responsibility. When you're in public life, even if you believe
                that it's not an opinion that you think is fair or founded, you do have to take
                responsibility. And I do. And I also have, you know, very much committed to the best
                of my ability my energies and efforts to helping people. That's something that I
                care deeply about. And I will continue to do that, to demonstrate by my past actions
                and my present levels of commitment and plans that people can count on me. That is
                certainly what happened to me in New York, where people got to know me. They saw me
                in action. And they did. Look, I have said before and it won't surprise anybody to
                hear me say it, this is not easy for me. It's not easy to do what I think is right,
                to help people, to even the odds, to hear a story like the woman's story we just
                heard. And to know that I can make a difference and I want to in every way possible.
                I am not a natural politician, in case you haven't noticed, like my husband or
                President Obama. So I have a view that I just have to do the best I can, get the
                results I can, make a difference in people's lives, and hope that people see that
                I'm fighting for them and that I can improve conditions economically and other ways
                that will benefit them and their families. </p>
               <p id="speech125">
            [TUMULTY]  Thank you. Thank you. [applause] Senator Sanders, you have
                demanded that Secretary Clinton release the transcripts of her paid Wall Street
                speeches. Why is this important? Do you have reason to believe that she says one
                thing in private and another in public? </p>
               <p id="speech126">
            [SANDERS]  Well, what I have said is that when you get I believe it is
                $225,000 for giving a speech, and she gave several speeches to Goldman Sachs, one of
                the Wall Street financial institutions whose greed and illegal behavior helped
                destroy our economy a number of years ago, when you get paid $225,000, that means
                that that speech must have been an extraordinarily wonderful speech. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech127">
            [TUMULTY]  So does this mean that you would not think she should have to
                disclose... </p>
               <p id="speech128">
            [SANDERS]  I would think that a speech so great that you got paid so
                much money for, you would like to share it with the American people. So I think she
                should release the transcript. [laughter and applause] [crosstalk] </p>
               <p id="speech129">
            [SANDERS]  As the secretary said, well, she will do it if other people
                do it. I will do it. I didn't give any speeches, there is no transcript. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech130">
            [TUMULTY]  But my question was, do you think she saying one thing in the
                speeches and another in public? </p>
               <p id="speech131">
            [SANDERS]  That is exactly what releasing the transcripts will tell us.
                This I do know. This I do know. There is a reason why Wall Street has provided $15
                million just in the last reporting period to the secretary's super PAC. Now, the
                secretary says it doesn't influence her. Well, that's what every politician says who
                gets money from special interests. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech132">
            [SANDERS]  The question that the American people have to determine - you
                know, can you say that Wall Street is greedy, they're fraudulent, but they're not
                dumb. Why are they making those kind of large contributions? </p>
               <p id="speech133">
            [TUMULTY]  Thank you, your time is up. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech134">
            [CLINTON]  Well, let me respond, as I have numerous times during this
                campaign. You know, I have a public record and you can go look it up. I went to Wall
                Street before the Great Recession and basically called them out, said that their
                behavior was putting our economy at risk, called for a moratorium on foreclosures. I
                went to the Orlando area during the '08 campaign to make the same case, visiting
                with families who had been defrauded by mortgages, these subprime mortgages that put
                them and their homes at risk. </p>
               <p id="speech135">
            [TUMULTY]  Thank you, Secretary Clinton. </p>
               <p id="speech136">
            [CLINTON]  I called for those changes. I have been on the record and now
                I do have the toughest, most comprehensive plan to go after Wall Street. And not
                just the big banks, all the other financial interests that pose a threat to our
                economy. And I have said no bank is too big to fail and no executive is too powerful
                to jail, and I will use the powers that have now been passed by the Congress, by
                President Obama, who, incidentally, took a lot of money from Wall Street, which
                didn't stop him from signing into law the toughest regulations on the financial
                industry since the Great Depression. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech137">
            [SANDERS]  Look, clearly, clearly, the secretary's words to Wall Street
                has really intimidated them, and that is why they have given her $15 million in
                campaign contributions. </p>
               <p id="speech138">
            [TUMULTY]  Thank you, Senator. </p>
               <p id="speech139">
            [SANDERS]  Now, what I believe is in fact that we have a corrupt
                campaign finance system. And it's not just Wall Street, it's the drug companies,
                [inaudible] received millions of dollars from the fossil fuel industry. We've got to
                overturn Citizens United and end that. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech140">
            [CLINTON]  Wait a minute. I just think it's worth pointing out that the
                leaders of the fossil fuel industry, the Koch brothers, have just paid to put up an
                ad praising Senator Sanders. There are a lot of different powerful interests in
                Washington. I've taken them on. I took on the drug companies. I took on the
                insurance companies. Before there was something called Obamacare, there was
                something called Hillarycare, and I worked really hard...[applause]...to get
                comprehensive health care reform, and they beat me. So I have a long record of
                standing up to special interests. And I will continue to do so. </p>
               <p id="speech141">
            [RAMOS]  We're going to move on to the next question. [booing]

               <p id="speech143">
            [SANDERS]  There is nobody in the United States Congress who has taken
                on the Koch brothers, who want to destroy Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and
                virtually every federal program passed since the 1930s more that Bernie Sanders.
                [applause] And I am proud that the gentleman who is head of Goldman Sachs, now, he
                didn't give me $225,000 for speaking fees, he said I was dangerous and he's right. I
                am dangerous for Wall Street. [applause] </p>

            [CLINTON]  ... you know though, I guess Senator Sanders, that the Koch
                brothers, as you said, are sensible with how they use their money. And I agree with
                you. They stand for things that I find abhorrent, that would be bad for our country,
                bad for our future. But they did just put up a little video praising you for being
                the only Democrat who stood with the Republicans to try to eliminate the
                Export/Import Bank, which has helped hundreds and hundreds of companies here in
                Florida be able to export their goods and employ more Floridians. So from my
                perspective, you sided with the Koch brothers. [applause] </p>

            [RAMOS]  OK, next question. I want to continue with the issue of trust.
                Secretary Clinton, on the night of the attacks in Benghazi, you sent an e-mail to
                your daughter Chelsea...[booing]...saying, that Al Qaida was responsible for the
                killing of the Americans. [booing] However, some of the families claim that you lied
                to them. To that speed, the mother of the information officer, Chaznea. Let's
                listen. [begin video clip] </p>
               <p id="speech153">
            [SMITH]  Hillary and Obama and Panetta and Biden and all of — and Susan
                Rice, all told me it was a video, when they knew it was not the video. And they said
                that they would call me and let me know what the outcome was. [end video clip] </p>
               <p id="speech154">
            [RAMOS]  Secretary Clinton, did you lie to them? </p>
               <p id="speech155">
            [CLINTON]  You know, look. I feel a great deal of sympathy for the
                families of the four brave Americans that we lost at Benghazi. And I certainly can't
                even imagine the grief that she has for losing her son, but she's wrong. She's
                absolutely wrong. I and everybody in the administration, all the people she named,
                the president, the vice president, Susan Rice, we were scrambling to get information
                that was changing, literally by the hour. And when we had information, we made it
                public. But then sometimes we had to go back and say we have new information that
                contradicts it. So I testified for 11 hours. [applause] Anybody who watched that and
                listened to it knows that I answered every question that I was asked and when it was
                over the Republicans had to admit they didn't learn anything. Why? Because there had
                already been one independent investigation. There had been seven or eight
                congressional investigations, mostly led by Republicans who all reached the same
                conclusions, that there were lessons to be learned. And this is not the first time
                we lost Americans in a terrorist attack. We lost 3,000 people on 9/11. We lost
                Americans serving in embassies in Tanzania and Kenya when my husband was president.
                We lost 250 Americans, both military and civilian, when Ronald Reagan was president
                in Beirut. And at no other time were those tragedies were they politicized
                [applause]. Instead people said, let's learn the lessons and save lives. And that's
                when I did. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech156">
            [RAMOS]  But Secretary Clinton, what they're saying is that — what the
                families are saying is that you told your daughter Chelsea one thing and a different
                thing to them. </p>
               <p id="speech157">
            [CLINTON]  Jorge, that makes my point. At the time I e-mailed with my
                daughter, a terrorist group had taken credit for the attacks on our facility in
                Benghazi. Within 16, 18 hours, they rescinded taking credit. They did it all on
                social media. And the video did play a role. We have captured one of the lead
                terrorists and he admits it was both a terrorist attack and it was influenced by the
                video. This was fog of war. This was complicated. The most effective, comprehensive
                reports and studies demonstrate that. Look, as I said in the beginning, I deeply
                regret that we lost four Americans. </p>
               <p id="speech158">
            [RAMOS]  Thank you senator. </p>
               <p id="speech159">
            [CLINTON]  And I of course sympathize with members of the families who
                are still, you know, very much grieving. And I wish that there could be an easy
                answer at the time, but we learned a lot, and the intelligence kept... </p>
               <p id="speech160">
            [RAMOS]  Thank you. </p>
               <p id="speech161">
            [CLINTON]  ... improving, and we learned enough to say what we think
                happened at Benghazi. </p>
               <p id="speech162">
            [RAMOS]  You have 30 seconds, Senator. </p>
               <p id="speech163">
            [SANDERS]  Well, I'm not going to comment on the Benghazi tragedy, but I
                will say this. A series of articles in the New York Times talked about Secretary
                Clinton's role in urging the administration to go forward with regime change,
                getting rid of Gadhafi in Libya. Gadhafi was a brutal dictator, there's no question.
                But one of the differences between the secretary and I is I'm not quite so
                aggressive with regard to regime change. I voted against the war in Iraq because I
                had a fear of what would happen the day after. [applause] And Secretary Clinton
                talks about Henry Kissinger... </p>
               <p id="speech164">
            [RAMOS]  Thank you, Senator. </p>
               <p id="speech165">
            [SANDERS]  ... winning the praise of Henry Kissinger, I don't want Henry
                Kissinger's praise at all. [applause] </p>

                evening. We heard a lot about <span class="immigration">immigration</span>, about the deportations and race. In your opinion,

               <p id="speech170">
            [QUESTION] [through translator]: The two candidates did a good action of
                talking, explaining, but what concerned me a bit is that we — we haven't seen the
                plan of Senator Bernie Sanders, and we have not seen a plan in writing from
                Secretary Hillary Clinton. So we want to see what she says. That is important, The
                six months — that we have seen as <span class="immigration">immigration</span> is concerned, and we see that they're moving towards.
                The community needs to not only immigration
                    reform, but the raids have to stop. Families that we have seen that
                are suffering, they have to be reunited. </p>

               <p id="speech172">
            [QUESTION] [through translator]: I believe that this was the saddest
                moment that we had here at the debate, a mother with her children, separated from
                her husband. And those children suffering because they do not have their father. And
                this is what we see that is happening, that Republicans are doing not — by not
                approving a migratory reform, but also
                President Obama. So we need — we need not only words, but plans as well. And we need
                as a community to both stand up and support women as her. </p>

            [SALINAS]  Thank you, [inaudible]. We'll continue with the debate now.
                Senator Sanders, you call your opponent Hillary Clinton an establishment politician.
                You yourself are a career politician. Why should voters prefer a career politicians
                over an establishment politician? </p>
               <p id="speech175">
            [SANDERS]  Well, you've got to look at what the career is about. And
                this is a career that has stood up to every special interest in this country. I
                don't take money from Wall Street. I demand that we break up the large financial
                institutions. I don't take money from the pharmaceutical industry because I believe
                they are ripping off the American people and charging us the highest prices in the
                world for prescription drugs. [applause] I don't take money from the fossil fuel
                industry because they are destroying — they are destroying this planet [through
                their emissions of carbon and creating the terrible climate change that we are
                seeing. So I think it is true that I have served in Congress for many years. But if
                you check my record, it is a record of strength for the environment, for workers,
                for seniors. Unlike the secretary, I believe we should expand Social Security
                benefits. It is a record of achievement for veterans, working with Republicans,
                helping to craft the most significant veterans healthcare bill passed in many
                decades. So I think the point is look at the record, and it's a record that I am
                proud of. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech176">
            [SALINAS]  Secretary, [inaudible] Latinos, according to the
                Univision-Washington Post poll, the number one issue is jobs and the economy. Latino
                unemployment rate is higher than the national average. Their net worth has gone down
                42 percent during the Obama years, and 60 percent of Latinos make less than $15 an
                hour. So, last week you tweeted that for the GOP, the economy is an after thought.
                Well, many Latinos feel that they are an after thought. Do you understand what the
                specific needs of Latinos are to improve their living conditions? </p>
               <p id="speech177">
            [CLINTON]  Well, I certainly know what all Americans need, and that is
                more jobs, with rising incomes. It's something that I have worked on for many years.
                It's why I've laid down the only really comprehensive plan about how to create more
                good jobs. And there are several things that need to be addressed. We do have to do
                more infrastructure spending. That will put many Americans to work. It's a good job
                that gets you on the ladder to the middle class. We need to improve the conditions
                for manufacturing in our country and punish those companies that want to export
                jobs. We need them to be incentivized to create jobs right here in America. We also
                do have to combat climate change, and no state has more at stake in that than
                Florida. And the best way to do that is not only enforcing the laws we have, but
                also the clean power plan that President Obama has put forth that I support, and the
                Paris agreement that I think was a huge step forward in the world, that Senator
                Sanders said was too weak, but I helped to lay the groundwork for that. But we need
                more clean energy jobs and we have to do more to help small businesses. You know,
                the fastest-growing segment of small businesses are minority and women-owned small
                business, and we need to help businesses get started. The very distinguished
                congresswoman from New York who's been on the Small Business Committee,
                Congresswoman Velasquez, knows exactly what we need to be doing to create more small
                businesses. We do need to raise the minimum wage and we have to guarantee equal pay
                for women. </p>
               <p id="speech178">
            [SALINAS]  Secretary, what would you do... </p>
               <p id="speech179">
            [CLINTON]  That will help Latinos as well as every other working person
                in our country. [applause] </p>

            <div class="imm">
               <p id="speech180">
            [SALINAS]  Secretary, you talked in general terms, but you haven't
                really said what you would specifically do to improve the living conditions of
                Latinos. </p>
               <p id="speech181">
            [CLINTON]  Everything I just said will improve the living conditions,
                and I've spent a lot of time and effort talking to and mostly listening to Latinos.
                Jobs are the number one issue, with rising incomes. Close behind is education. Every
                child deserves a good teacher in a good school, regardless of the zip code that they
                live in. Following behind that is health care and how important it is to continue to
                build on the Affordable Care Act and provide access to health care. And then there
                are a number of other issues — comprehensive
                    immigration reform certainly at the top. </p>
               <p id="speech182">
            [SALINAS]  Your time is up, Secretary — sorry, your time is up. </p>
               <p id="speech183">
            [SANDERS]  OK, let me answer that question because it's a huge question.
                And one of the — huge, I know. [laughter] One of the points that I've been making,
                and media does not seem to pick up on it, is that we have a real crisis not only
                with real unemployment in America being close to 10 percent, but youth unemployment

                legislation to put $5 billion into a jobs program to put our kids to work because I

            [RAMOS]  We have a question on education. Senator, I'll continue with
                you. You propose free college tuition. </p>
               <p id="speech190">
            [SANDERS]  No, I do not propose free college tuition, I proposed free
                tuition at public colleges and universities. Yes I did. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech191">
            [RAMOS]  So under your plan, potentially, millions of students who can
                not truly afford college would be getting federal subsidies. Is that right? </p>
               <p id="speech192">
            [SANDERS]  No. What they would — look, this is what I believe, Jorge.
                This is the year 2016. Fifty years ago a high school degree got you a good job in
                the economy. Today, in many respects, a college degree is the equivalent of a high
                school degree. We have got to go beyond first grade to 12th grade when we talk about
                public education. [applause] So I do believe we should make public colleges and
                universities tuition-free, and I don't believe we should punish millions of young
                and not-so-young people with outrageous levels of student debt. </p>
               <p id="speech193">
            [RAMOS]  Because my question was if you think, for instance, if Donald
                Trump's grandchildren or — I'm sorry — Hillary Clinton's grandchildren, should they
                be able to go for free? </p>
               <p id="speech194">
            [SANDERS]  Absolutely. </p>
               <p id="speech195">
            [RAMOS]  For free. </p>
               <p id="speech196">
            [SANDERS]  Absolutely. They can go — I don't think they will, but Donald
                Trump's kids — Donald Trump's kids can go to public school right now, I think
                Secretary Clinton is talking about making community colleges free, they can go to
                those things. The point is we are going to get to Donald Trump by raising the taxes
                on the top 1 percent and our millionaires and billionaires. But all of our people,
                in my view, regardless of income, should have a right to get a higher education. I
                want children in the third grade to know that if they study hard, no matter what the
                income of their families, my family didn't have any income, my parents didn't go to
                college, they didn't have good income. I want every kid to know if you do your
                school work, study hard, yes, you will be able to get a college education.

            [QUESTION] [through translator]: We just heard about free tuition from
                Senator Sanders, but right now there are millions of students who can't afford to
                pay their loans. Maria Martinez is 20 years old and she's a major of political
                science at Miami-Dade College. </p>
               <p id="speech199">
            [UNKNOWN]  Secretary Clinton, she said she wants to go to grad school
                and get a PhD. What are you going to do to help her achieve that goal and pay off
                her student debt? </p>
               <p id="speech200">
            [CLINTON]  Well, congratulations on your education. And also on your
                plans for the future. And here's what I will do. We're going to refinance everyone's
                existing student debt, 40 million Americans have student debt. [applause] And right
                now, I go around asking people at my events if they know what their interest rate is
                and the interest rates literally go from like 8 percent to 14 percent. It's
                outrageous that at a time when interest rates have been historically low, people
                borrowing money to invest in their education are paying some of the highest interest
                rates around. And you can refinance your house to get a lower interest rate. You can
                refinance your car. Corporations can refinance their debt. Under my plan, you will
                be able to also lower your debt, move into a program to pay it back as a percentage
                of your income and more than that, my plan for debt-free tuition at public colleges
                and universities will eventually eliminate any student debt. But for people who have
                it, I'm going to put a date certain that after a certain number of years, you no
                longer have to pay anything. The government has to quit making money off of lending
                money to young people to get their education. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech201">
            [UNKNOWN]  Karen, let's go back to you. </p>
               <p id="speech202">
            [SANDERS]  I think what Secretary Clinton just said is absolutely right.
                I think I said it many months before she said it, but thanks for copying a very good
                idea. [applause] Now the question though, you know, I have been criticized a lot for
                thinking big. You know, that's for believing that we can do great things as a
                nation. One of the things we should not be doing obviously, is punishing people for
                doing what we want them to do and that is to get an education. [applause] But here
                is the point. My program, making public colleges and universities tuition free,
                allowing people with debt to refinance at the lowest possible interest rates is a
                fairly expensive proposal, about $70 billion a year. You know how I'm going to pay
                for it? I'm going to pay for it by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation.
                [applause] We bailed out — Secretary Clinton was one of those who voted to bail out
                Wall Street. Now I think it's time for Wall Street to help the working families of
                this country. </p>
               <p id="speech203">
            [RAMOS]  Thank you senator. Thank you very much. </p>
               <p id="speech204">
            [CLINTON]  Well, I'm going to respond to that, because I think it's a
                very important issue. And by the way, everybody, who, quote, "got money" in the
                quote, "bailout", that also included money for the auto rescue has paid it back. So,
                the Treasury was out nothing. Now that will no longer happen because we have
                Dodd-Frank and we will break up banks that pose a systemic threat to our economy.
                [applause] But let me say this. Senator Sanders has talked about free college for
                everybody. He's talked about universal, single payer health care for everybody. And
                yet, when you ask questions, as many of us have and more importantly, independent
                experts, it's very hard to get answers. And a lot of the answers say that this is
                going to be much more expensive than anything Senator Sanders is admitting to. This
                is going to increase the federal government dramatically. And, you know, my dad used
                to say, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. </p>
               <p id="speech205">
            [SANDERS]  All right. Let me respond to this. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech206">
            [CLINTON]  And we deserve answers about how these programs will actually
                work and how they would be paid for. </p>
               <p id="speech207">
            [SANDERS]  I want you all to think. What Secretary Clinton is saying is
                that the United States should continue to be the only major country on earth that
                doesn't guarantee health care to all of our people. [applause] I think if the rest
                of the world can do it, we can. And by the way, not only are we being ripped off by
                the drug companies, we are spending far, far more per capita on health care than any
                other major country on earth. You may not think the American people are prepared to
                stand up to the insurance companies or the drug companies. I think they are. And I
                think we can pass... </p>
               <p id="speech208">
            [RAMOS]  Thank you senator.[crosstalk] [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech209">
            [CLINTON]  This is a very important point in this debate, because I do
                believe in universal coverage. Remember, I fought for it 25 years ago. I believe in
                it. And I know that thanks the Affordable Care Act, we are now 90 percent of
                universal coverage. I will build on the Affordable Care Act. I will take it further.
                I will reduce the cost. But I just respectfully disagree. Between the Republicans
                trying to repeal the first chance we've ever had to get to universal health care,
                and Senator Sanders wanting to throw us into a contentious debate over single-payer,
                I think the smart approach is build on and protect the Affordable Care Act. Make it
                work. Reduce the cost. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech210">
            [SANDERS]  I'm on the committee, I know a little bit about this, I'm on
                the committee, Health, Education, Labor Committee that helped write the Affordable
                Care Act. And it has done a number of good things. But when Secretary Clinton says,
                well, 90 percent of the people have insurance, yes, not really. Many of you may have
                insurance, but you have outrageously high deductibles and co-payments. One out of
                five Americans cannot afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe. Elderly
                people are cutting their pills in half. I do believe that we should do what every
                other major country on earth does, and I think when the American people stand up and
                fight back, yes, we can have it, a Medicare for all health care system. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech211">
            [TUMULTY]  I'm going to call time here because I want to move on to a
                subject that more than two dozen Florida mayors have asked to raise with you. They
                have asked us to share with you their concern over the effects of rising sea levels
                and climate change in their communities. [applause] Just take a look at this map.
                You can see that no state has more at stake than Florida does. And no city has more
                at stake than Miami, the city in which we are sitting. But many Republicans argue
                that this is not a man-made problem. Senator Sanders, is it possible to move forward
                on this issue if you do not get a bipartisan consensus, and what would you do? </p>
               <p id="speech212">
            [SANDERS]  Well, first of all, Karen, when you have Republican
                candidates for president and in Congress telling you that climate change is a hoax,
                which is Donald Trump and other candidates' position, what they are really saying
                is, we don't have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry. [applause] What
                candidates are saying is if we stand up to the fossil fuel industry, and transform
                our energy system away from coal and oil and gas to energy efficiency and wind and
                solar and geothermal and other sustainable technologies, you know what happens to
                that Republican who listens to the scientists? On that day, that Republican loses
                his campaign funding from the Koch brothers and the fossil fuel industry. </p>
               <p id="speech213">
            [TUMULTY]  So you've just described the problem, but how would you move
                forward given that this is the situation? </p>
               <p id="speech214">
            [SANDERS]  The way I would move forward in every other area. And what we
                are doing in this campaign is fighting not only to become president, but I'm the
                only candidate who says no president, not Bernie Sanders, can do it all. You know
                what we need, Karen? We need a political revolution in this country. [applause] And
                when millions of people stand up and tell the fossil fuel industry that their
                profits, their short-term profits are less significant than the long-term health of
                this planet, we will win. That is the way change always takes place. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech215">
            [TUMULTY]  Secretary Clinton, can we do this without a bipartisan
                consensus? No major environmental legislation has ever passed without bipartisan
                votes. </p>
               <p id="speech216">
            [CLINTON]  Well, Karen, first of all, I was proud a number of mayors
                from Florida campaign for me in South Carolina. I had a chance to talk to some of
                them about this issue. It is a really serious one. And there isn't much time left to
                do several things that I will move quickly to do. You can see already what's
                happening in Miami, particularly in Miami Beach with tides rising. So we do have to
                invest in resilience and mitigation while we are trying to cut emissions and make up
                for the fact that this is clearly man-made and man-aggravated. And there are certain
                things that the president has done [through executive action that I will absolutely
                support. All the Republican say they will, if they're elected, heaven forbid, repeal
                all of those executive actions. I will maintain them and act on them. The clean
                power plan is something that Senator Sanders has said he would delay implementing,
                which makes absolutely no sense. We need to implement all of the president's
                executive actions and quickly move to make a bridge from coal to natural gas to
                clean energy. That is the way we will keep the lights on while we are transitioning
                to a clean energy future. And when I talk about resilience, I think that is an area
                we can get Republican support on. [crosstalk] </p>

                we are serious about climate change, about imposing a tax on carbon on the fossil
                fuel industry and making massive investments in energy efficiency and sustainable
                energy. And by the way, while we are on the subject of energy, I hope you'll join me

            [TUMULTY]  Secretary Clinton, Senator Elizabeth Warren — Senator
                Elizabeth Warren says personnel is policy. And she says that there is a revolving
                door between Wall Street and the highest levels of economic policy-making and
                regulation in Washington. Three of the last four Treasury secretaries appointed by
                Democratic presidents had ties to Citigroup. Do you agree with Elizabeth Warren's
                criticism that both your husband's administration and President Obama's have relied
                too heavily on advisers who represent the world view of the big banks? </p>
               <p id="speech232">
            [CLINTON]  Well, Karen, I do agree that we have to end the revolving
                door. I strongly support a piece of legislation from Senator Tammy Baldwin that
                would do just that. And I will be looking for people who will put the interests of
                consumers first, who will do more to try to make sure Main Street flourishes. And I
                will very much reach out and ask for advice as to who should be appointed, including
                to Senator Warren and many of my other former colleagues in the Senate. But I think
                it's important also to look at what we want to accomplish. You know, in the debates
                we've had — maybe this is the seventh or so — Senator Sanders is always criticizing
                the two recent Democratic presidents — President Clinton and President Obama. And
                that's fine, but I wish he would criticize and join me in criticizing George W.
                Bush, who I think wrecked the economy and created the conditions for the great
                recession. You know, at the end of the '90s, we had 23 million new jobs. Incomes
                went up for everybody. We were talking earlier about what needs to be done for
                Latinos and African Americans. Well, we were doing it by the end of the '90s. Median
                family income went up 17 percent. For minorities, it went up even more. Along came
                the Republicans, trickle-down economics — one of the worst ideas since snake oil —
                was put back into place. And we ended up with the great recession. President Obama
                had to rescue the economy. And I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for
                doing that. </p>
               <p id="speech233">
            [TUMULTY]  Senator Sanders, your name was mentioned. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech234">
            [SANDERS]  Now, let me say this. I gather Secretary Clinton hasn't
                listened to too many of my speeches. [laughter] Or followed my work in the Congress
                as very few people stood up to George W. Bush whether it was the war in Iraq or any
                other of his policies. [laughter] Now, when we talk about the policies of the 1990s,
                I worked closely and supported President Clinton. And obviously, I have worked very
                closely in supporting President Obama, who has taken our economy a very long way
                from where Bush left us. But when you go back to the 1990s, let's remember, that's
                when Wall Street deregulation took place. </p>

               <p id="speech245">
            [RAMOS]  Let's talk about Latin America. Secretary Clinton and Senator
                Sanders, it will be my welcome to Miami question. So it goes as follows. President
                Barack Obama is going to Cuba in two weeks. Forty percent of Cuban Americans
                supporting to uphold — oppose a new White House policy towards Cuba. If you were
                president, would you meet with the dissidents in Cuba? Would you meet with Fidel
                Castro? And would you consider Raul Castro a president or a dictator? Welcome to
                Miami. </p>
               <p id="speech246">
            [CLINTON]  Well, first of all, I supported the president's moves. I
                helped to implement some of them leading up to the announcements when I was
                secretary of state, expanding travel opportunities, remittances. And I certainly
                told the president toward the end of my time that I hoped he would be able to move
                toward diplomatic relations and to make more of an impact by building up the
                relationship. And there are no better ambassadors for freedom, democracy and
                economic opportunity than Cuban Americans. So the more that we can have that kind of
                movement back and forth, the more likely we are to be able to move Cuba toward
                greater freedom, greater respect for rights. You know, I'm looking forward to
                following the president's trip. I do think meeting with dissidents, meeting with
                people who have been voices, tribunes of freedom and opportunity is important. The
                Cuban people deserve to have their human rights respected and upheld, they deserve
                to be able to move towards democracy where they pick their own leads. And I think
                both Castros have to be considered authoritarian and dictatorial because they are
                not freely chosen by the people that are in Cuba. [applause] I hope someday there
                will be leaders who are chosen by the Cuban people, and I hope that democracy will
                be deeply rooted in Cuban soil and that the people of Cuba will have every
                opportunity to fulfill their own dreams in their own country. That is my hope. </p>
               <p id="speech247">
            [SALINAS]  Senator Sanders... </p>
               <p id="speech248">
            [RAMOS]  On Facebook, by the way, this is the conversation that
                everybody is having, talking about Cuba. Senator Sanders. </p>
               <p id="speech249">
            [SANDERS]  Look, I understand that not everybody in Florida or in the
                United States will agree with me, but I think we have got to end the embargo.
                [applause] I believe that we should move towards full and normalized political
                relations with Cuba. I think at the end of the day, it will be a good thing for the
                Cuban people. It will enable them, I think when they see people coming into their
                country from the United States, move in a more democratic direction, which is what I
                want to see. So right — I'm sorry. </p>
               <p id="speech250">
            [SALINAS]  Let's continue with another question, Senator, if you don't
                mind. </p>
               <p id="speech251">
            [SANDERS]  Sure. </p>
               <p id="speech252">
            [SALINAS]  In 1985, you praised the Sandinista government and you said
                that Daniel Ortega was an impressive guy. This is what you said about Fidel Castro.
                Let's listen. [begin video clip] </p>
               <p id="speech253">
            [SANDERS]  You may recall way back in, when was it, 1961, they invaded
                Cuba, and everybody was totally convinced that Castro was the worst guy in the
                world. All the Cuban people were going to rise up in rebellion against Fidel Castro.
                They forgot that he educated their kids, gave them health care, totally transformed
                their society. [end video clip] </p>
               <p id="speech254">
            [SALINAS]  In South Florida there are still open wounds among some
                exiles regarding socialism and communism. So please explain what is the difference
                between the socialism that you profess and the socialism in Nicaragua, Cuba and
                Venezuela. </p>
               <p id="speech255">
            [SANDERS]  Well, let me just answer that. What that was about was saying
                that the United States was wrong to try to invade Cuba, that the United States was
                wrong trying to support people to overthrow the Nicaraguan government, that the
                United States was wrong trying to overthrow in 1954, the government — democratically
                elected government of Guatemala. Throughout the history of our relationship with
                Latin America we've operated under the so-called Monroe Doctrine, and that said the
                United States had the right do anything that they wanted to do in Latin America. So
                I actually went to Nicaragua and I very shortly opposed the Reagan administration's
                efforts to overthrow that government. And I strongly opposed earlier Henry Kissinger
                and the — to overthrow the government of Salvador Aliende in Chile. I think the
                United States should be working with governments around the world, not get involved
                in regime change. And all of these actions, by the way, in Latin America, brought
                forth a lot of very strong anti-American sentiments. That's what that was about. </p>
               <p id="speech256">
            [SALINAS]  Senator, in retrospect, have you ever regretted the
                characterizations that you made of Daniel Ortega and Fidel Castro that way? </p>
               <p id="speech257">
            [SANDERS]  I'm sorry. Please say that... </p>
               <p id="speech258">
            [SALINAS]  In retrospect, have you ever regretted the characterizations
                of Daniel Ortega and Fidel Castro that you made in 1985? </p>
               <p id="speech259">
            [SANDERS]  The key issue here was whether the United States should go
                around overthrowing small Latin American countries. I think that that was a
                mistake... </p>
               <p id="speech260">
            [SALINAS]  You didn't answer the question. </p>
               <p id="speech261">
            [SANDERS]  ...both in Nicaragua and Cuba. Look, let's look at the facts
                here. Cuba is, of course, an authoritarian undemocratic country, and I hope very
                much as soon as possible it becomes a democratic country. But on the other
                hand...[applause]...on the other hands, it would be wrong not to state that in Cuba
                they have made some good advances in health care. They are sending doctors all over
                the world. They have made some progress in education. I think by restoring full
                diplomatic relations with Cuba, it will result in significant improvements to the
                lives of Cubans and it will help the United States and our business community
                invest. </p>
               <p id="speech262">
            [SALINAS]  Thank you, Senator. Your time is up on that. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech263">
            [RAMOS]  Secretary, I have a question on Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is
                bankrupt. It owes more than $70 billion it cannot pay and we have a question from
                Facebook. Lian Purvea is asking you the following; I would like to know if during
                the first 100 days of your presidency, you will help Puerto Rico restructure its
                public debt and help its economy. The first 100 days, secretary. </p>
               <p id="speech264">
            [CLINTON]  Absolutely, although it happens before I am president if I am
                so fortunate to be. I have been calling for months that the Congress must give
                authority to Puerto Rico to restructure its debts. [applause] Just like it has
                enabled states and cities to restructure their debt. And it's a grave injustice for
                the Congress, led by the Republicans to be refusing to enact that opportunity within
                the bankruptcy law. And what we see in Puerto Rico now is a lot of suffering. We see
                schools being closed, we see health care being denied and we see a thousand Puerto
                Rican families a month moving to the United States, mostly to Florida. Puerto Ricans
                are citizen of America. [applause] They deserve to be treated as citizens and to be
                given the opportunity to get back on their feet economically. And I just want to add
                one thing to the question you were asking Senator Sanders. I think in that same
                interview, he praised what he called the revolution of values in Cuba and talked
                about how people were working for the common good, not for themselves. I just
                couldn't disagree more. You know, if the values are that you oppress people, you
                disappear people, you imprison people or even kill people for expressing their
                opinions, for expressing freedom of speech, that is not the kind of revolution of
                values that I ever want to see anywhere. [applause] </p>
               <p id="speech265">
            [SANDERS]  Well, as I said earlier, I don't believe it is the business
                of the United States government to be overthrowing small countries around the world.
                And number two, when you get to Puerto Rico, there's an issue that we have not
                talked about. That little island is $73 billion in debt and the government now is
                paying interest rates of up to 11 percent. And many of the bonds that they are
                paying off were purchased by vulture capitalists for 30 cents on the dollar. And
                what I have said in talking to the leaders of Puerto Rico, we've got to bring people
                together. And it's not the people of Puerto Rico, or the children or the schools. </p>
               <p id="speech266">
            [TUMULTY]  Senator, OK </p>
               <p id="speech267">
            [SANDERS]  But maybe some of these vulture capitalists who are going to
                have to lose a little bit of money in this process. </p>
               <p id="speech268">
            [TUMULTY]  We need to move on to another topic. Secretary Clinton, there
                is a vacancy on the supreme court at a very crucial moment. Among other things, the
                court is considering the most significant abortion restrictions in a generation. So
                I would like to share with you a question that we got from Facebook from Joshua
                Dansby, a law student in Washington, D.C. who wants to know what specific forms of
                qualifications you would look for in a Supreme Court justice? </p>
               <p id="speech269">
            [CLINTON]  Well, I think this is one of the most important issues facing
                our country right now. And I fully support President Obama's intention under the
                constitution to nominate a successor to Justice Scalia. And I
                believe...[applause]...I believe no state probably understands this better than
                Florida. Because let's remember three words: Bush versus Gore. [applause] A court
                took away a presidency. Now we've got the Republican Congress trying to take away
                the constitution. And we should not tolerate that. [applause] And so from my
                perspective, it is imperative that we put enormous pressure on the Republicans in
                the Senate to do their constitutional duty. Now, obviously you look for people who
                are not only qualified on paper, but have a heart, have life experience, understand
                what these decisions mean in the lives of Americans. And understand the balance of
                power that their decisions can disrupt one way or the other. So clearly, I would
                look for people who believe that Roe v. Wade is settled law and that Citizens United
                needs to be overturned as quickly as possible. [applause] </p>

            [CLINTON]  Well, thank you very much for a lively debate. And I

                people here and those coming at us from Facebook. It just reinforces my strong

                way of people living up to their own potential, and of our country doing the same.
                So I am going to take on those economic barriers. I have a plan to create jobs and
                raise incomes. I'm going to take on the education barriers that often leave too many
                children behind even after they have completed schooling. I'm going to take on the
                healthcare barriers. I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that we unite our
                country. I will find common ground, just as I have as first lady, as senator and
                secretary of state. I will also stand my ground wherever matters of principles are
                at stake. I would be honored to have your support in the upcoming primary on

               <p id="speech276">
            [SANDERS]  This has been a wonderful debate, but time being limited,
                some of the most important issues facing our country have not been asked. And that
                is, is it acceptable that in America the top 0.1 percent now owns almost as much
                wealth as the bottom 90 percent. Is it acceptable that while the average American
                works longer hours for lower wages, 58 percent of all new income is going to the top
                1 percent. Is it acceptable that Wall Street and billionaires are spending hundreds
                of millions of dollars trying to buy elections? Is that democracy or this that
                oligarchy? Which is why I believe we've got to overturn Citizens United and move to
                public funding of elections. Is it right that in the greatest, wealthiest country in
                the history of the world, so many of our young people can't even afford to go to
                college or leave school deeply in debt, in the wealthiest country in the history of
                the world? If we stand up, fight back, we can do a lot better. That's why I'm
                running for president. [applause] </p>

               <p id="speech278">
            [TUMULTY]  And on behalf of The Washington Post and Univision and
                Facebook, we'd like to thank you again for joining us in this debate and also to
                remind people to get out and vote. </p>
               <p id="speech279">
            [RAMOS] [through translator]: We want to use these last moments, it's
                very important to go out and vote, remember next Tuesday, March 15th is elections in
                Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, all these states — in all these
                states the Hispanic vote is crucial [inaudible]. Talk about the importance of
                Hispanic votes, how in very close races it is the Hispanic vote that can choose the
                next president of the United States. This is Hispanic power, but the only way that
                this can happen is if we all go out and vote. So you know it perfectly, who does not
                vote doesn't count. </p>
               <p id="speech280">
            [SALINAS] [through translator]: And as you know, nobody can reach the
                White House without the Hispanic vote. Remember, don't let others decide for you.
                The power is in your hands, you have to participate, you have to vote. Thank you for
                being with us this evening and thank you for trusting in Univision. Good evening. </p>
               <p id="speech281">
            [RAMOS]  Good evening.</p>
