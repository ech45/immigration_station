Gentlemen, we know how much you love hand-raising questions. So we promise, this is the only one tonight: the only one. Is there anyone on stage, and can I see hands, who is unwilling tonight to pledge your support to the eventual nominee of the Republican party and pledge to not run an independent campaign against that person. Again, we're looking for you to raise your hand now raise your hand now if you won't make that pledge tonight. Mr. Trump. [booing] Mr. Trump to be clear, you're standing on a Republican primary debate stage.
