I am not going to contradict the president's strategy on this. And I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals. I fully support the president. [applause] And I believe that the president â€” the president is on the right side of both the Constitution and history. And the Senate needs to immediately begin to respond. So I'm going to support the president. When I am president, I will take stock of where we are and move from there.
