Look, Hillary Clinton is a very good person. Martin O'Malley is a very decent guy. So I'm not - you know, this is not a - personal stuff. It just seems to me that the crises that we face as a country today, and we didn't even get into climate change to a significant degree: inequality, poverty in America, an obscene and unfair campaign finance system. These problems are so serious that we have got to go beyond establishment politics and establishment economics. In my view we need a political revolution where millions of people stand up and say you know what, that great government of ours belongs to all of us, not just the few. That's why I'm running for president. Thank you. [applause]
