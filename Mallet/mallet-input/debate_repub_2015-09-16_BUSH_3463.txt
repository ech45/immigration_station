There are 13,000 community-based organizations that provide health services to women, 13,000 in this country. I don't believe that Planned Parenthood should get a penny from the federal government. Those organizations should get funding, just as I increased funding when I was governor of the state. That's the way you do this is you improve the condition for people. And, Donald, when I was governor, we also increased the opportunities for women. Women's income grew three times faster than the national average when I was governor.
