Welcome back tonight to New Hampshire. The Democratic debate continues here on ABC. And Secretary Clinton, we want to turn to race, now, in America. There is a real concern in this country from Black Lives Matter and from other community groups that we're just now seeing, with smartphones and cell phones, what many have been dealing with for years when they come in contact with police. But you also have many in law enforcement who now say there has been a so-called Ferguson effect, police holding back because they're afraid of backlash.
