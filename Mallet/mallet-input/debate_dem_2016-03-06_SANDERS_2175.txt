Well, let's begin by discussing the problem. As you've indicated, the American Society of Civil Engineers say we need trillions of dollars — trillions of dollars — just to bring up our infrastructure to deal with — water systems like Flint, just to bring them up to decent levels. We have suggested a trillion-dollar investment. Now, you know how we're gonna pay for that? I'll tell you how we're gonna pay for that. Right now, this country is losing $100 billion every single year because profitable corporations are stashing their profits in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and in other tax havens...[applause]...and in some cases, not paying five cents in federal income tax. I will eliminate that outrageous loophole, and we will raise $1 trillion. And by the way, not only do we rebuild our crumbling infrastructure — $1 trillion over five years creates 13 million decent-paying jobs.
