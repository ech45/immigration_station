What is going is a disgrace beyond belief. As the president of the United States, this is what I would do is if local government does not have the resources â€” if state government for whatever reason America shouldn't be poisoned, federal government comes in, federal government acts. [applause] What is absolute incredible to me is that water rates have soared in Flint. You are paying three times more for poison water than I am paying in Burlington, Vermont for clean water. First thing is you say, people are not paying a water bill for poison and that is retroactive. [applause] Second of all, to ease anxiety, CDC has to come in and examine every child and adult in this community in terms of the amount of lead they may have. Thirdly, the wealthiest country has to rebuild the crumbling infrastructure, our water systems. I have a bill for a trillion dollars, it creates 13 million jobs rebuilding flint, Michigan and communities all over the country.
