Right. Senator, then the pushback becomes how you pay. Now, in this room, you're preaching to the converted, somewhat, right? These are presumptively Democrats. But, you will hear people say that you're paying for it is actually punitive. You're going to punish people who make money, you're going to punish the financial district, you're going to punish and wind up changing the idea of an open and free economy because you're going to punish them for speculating. Which means they won't speculate as much, which means you won't get as much activity. And, if you do a checklist of how you pay for everything, what you're doing is amassing the biggest government ever after President Clinton said the era of big government was over. It seems like Bernie Sanders is saying, Not only it's over, I'm going to do it bigger than ever.
