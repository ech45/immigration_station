All right. Well, Dr. Carson, I have got a question now for you. A moment of pause here. You have said, Dr. Carson, that â€” referring to yourself, that people bought into the idea that, quote, "A nice person can't be tough on terrorists." You have called for loosening the rules of engagement for the military, which could lead to more civilian casualties. So, explain why those casualties would be acceptable in the fight against ISIS?
