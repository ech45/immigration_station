I voted for the bill, and the reason I voted for the bill is you got a bill which has a number of elements in it, among other things it has a section which says we should not be selling ammunition which will pierce policemans armor and protection. I think that's a right thing. It had a section in it which said that we want to have safety locks for children on guns. That makes sense to me. It also had a provision in it which says the following - and people may disagree with me, this is my view. Is that if you are a small gun shop in Vermont, and I legally sell you a weapon, OK? You go out, buy that gun legally, and then you go out and kill somebody. I think the gun shop owner should not be held liable to your criminal act. That's what I believe. Now, within that bill also there was some onerous provision. Not good provisions. What happens if a gun manufacturer is selling a whole lot of guns into an area, far more guns than that area can consume? And, what happens if that gun owner - that gun manufacturer should know that those guns are going into criminal hands. Should that gun manufacturer be held liable? Yes, he should. So, I am willing now to look at that legislation, maintain what was good in it, get rid of what is bad in it.
