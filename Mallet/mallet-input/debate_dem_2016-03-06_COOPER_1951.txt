And welcome to The Whiting Auditorium on the campus of the Flint Cultural Center in Flint, Michigan for a special CNN democratic presidential debate. I'm Anderson Cooper. I want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. Tonight's debate will be seen on CNN, CNN International, CNN en Espanol, by American soldiers, sailors, and airmen on the American Forces Network, and nationwide on the Westwood One Radio Network. And now we want to welcome the Democratic candidates for president of the United States, please welcome Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. [applause] Please welcome former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. [applause] Ladies and gentlemen, the Democratic candidates for president of the United States! [applause] Before we begin tonight, we want to take a moment to remember former first lady Nancy Reagan. As probably know she passed away this morning at the age of 94. Her grace and elegance in the White House, her deep love for President Reagan, and her strength and advocacy in the fight against Alzheimer's and drug abuse will always be remembered. We would like to pause of a moment of silence in honor of Mrs. Reagan. And now will you please rise for our national anthem performed by the Flint City Wide Choir, conducted by Darnell Ishmel. [The National Anthem is performed] [applause]
