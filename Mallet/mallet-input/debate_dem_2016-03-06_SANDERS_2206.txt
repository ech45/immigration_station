... That was one of the nice things that he said about me. [laughter] I'll tell you something, this is my right arm. I'm prepared to give — no, I shouldn't say that. I would love to run against Donald Trump, and I'll tell you why. For a start, but almost — not all, but almost every poll has shown that Sanders versus Trump does a lot better than Clinton versus Trump. [applause] Right here in Michigan there was a poll done, I think yesterday, or today, had me beating Trump in Michigan by 22 points. [applause] Secretary Clinton beat him as well, but not by so much. And, that's true nationally, and in many other states. And, the other reason I think we can beat Trump is that our campaign is generating an enormous amount of excitement. Just in the last two days we have won the caucuses in Maine, we won that tonight with a very large turnout. [applause and cheering] We won Nebraska, we won Kansas, and Kansas was the biggest turnout in their caucus history. I think we are exciting working class people, young people who are prepared to stand up and demand that we have a government that represents all of us.
