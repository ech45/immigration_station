I don't think that anybody would suggest that Israel invites and welcomes missiles flying into their country. That is not the issue. And, you evaded the answer. You evaded the question. The question is not does Israel have a right to respond, nor does Israel have a right to go after terrorists and destroy terrorism. That's not the debate. Was their response disproportionate? I believe that it was, you have not answered that. [cheering]
