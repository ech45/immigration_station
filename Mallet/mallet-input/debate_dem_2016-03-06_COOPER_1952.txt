Our thanks to the Flint City Wide Choir. Candidates take your positions behind the podium. Before we begin as the candidates take their positions, I just want to set out some ground rules as moderators, I'll ask questions, I'll ask follow- ups and guide the discussion. The candidates will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer questions. They'll have 30 seconds for follow- ups. CNN's Don Lemon will join me in the questioning, as will members of our audience here tonight. The members of our audience are Democrats and independents from Flint and elsewhere in Michigan. We've reviewed their questions just so they don't overlap. Now we've come to Flint because this is a city in crisis, a city where, as you probably know, the tap water is toxic. Public servants, public institutions not only failed to prevent the crisis, their decisions created this crisis. The state of Michigan, in an effort to save money, switched Flint's water source to a cheaper, but riskier alternative, the Flint River. Safeguards were ignored. That river water corroded residential pipes, and for nearly two years, lead leaked into the water used in people's homes. Now, for much of that time, the state downplayed the danger, even in the face of growing complaints and physical evidence. For 100 days, the federal government knew about it, and yet in all that time nobody told the people of Flint. They bathed in the water, they drank it, and so did their kids. Even today, lead is still present in some of the water. Tonight the Democratic candidates are here to answer questions about what they would do for Flint, as well as about other issues facing their country right now. Each candidate has one minute for an opening statement, Senator Sanders is first. We begin with him. Senator Sanders?
