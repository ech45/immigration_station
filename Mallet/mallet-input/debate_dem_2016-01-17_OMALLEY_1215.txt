Thank you. Lester, on this stage tonight, this Democratic stage, where we actually believe in science. [laughter] I would like to challenge and invite my colleagues here on this stage to join me in putting forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean, electric energy grid by 2050. It can be done. [applause] With solar, with wind, with new technologies, with green buildings, this can happen, but in all â€” President Obama made us more energy independent, but in all of the above strategy didn't land us on the moon, we need American ingenuity and we need to reach by 2050 for the sake of our kids.
