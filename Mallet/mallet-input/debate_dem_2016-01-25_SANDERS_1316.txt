President Obama is obviously right. Being president is an enormously difficult job. It's a job that entails dealing with a million different issues. I think I have the background, I think I have the judgement to do that. I would remind you, and remind the viewers that in 2002, when George W. Bush and Dick Cheney said we should go to war in Iraq, Bernie Sanders listened very carefully and I said no. I think that war is a dumb idea. I helped lead the opposition to that war. And, if you go to my website, listen to what I said, and sadly enough - it gives me no joy. Much of what I feared would happen did happen. I do believe I have the background for the job.
