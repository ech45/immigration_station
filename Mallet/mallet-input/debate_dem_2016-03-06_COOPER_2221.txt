I want to thank both the candidates. While we've been debating tonight, CNN has learned that a labor union fund has committed $25 million in low-interest loans to help replace lead- contaminated pipes. I want to thank the candidates, the Democratic National Committee...[applause]...our hosts here at the Flint Cultural Center, and most of all, the people of Flint. Just two days from now, it's another Super Tuesday, when Michigan and three other states have primaries. We'll have all-day coverage. On Wednesday we'll simulcast the next Democratic presidential debate. We'll air on CNN in English, and then on Univision in Spanish. And on Thursday, CNN hosts a Republican presidential debate in Miami â€” the last one before the critical Florida and Ohio primaries. We'll have full analysis of tonight's debate in one hour. Right now, please stay tuned for the premiere of a brand-new CNN original series about great American presidential races. Here is The Race for the White House.
