Well, it is true that now that the spotlight is pretty bright here in New York, some things have been said and Senator Sanders did call me unqualified. I've been called a lot of things in my life. That was a first. [laughter] And then he did say that... [applause]...he had to question my judgment. Well, the people of New York voted for me twice to be their senator from New York and...[applause]...and...[applause]...and President Obama trusted my judgment enough to ask me to be secretary of State for the United States. [applause] So, look, we have disagreements on policy. There's no doubt about it. But if you go and read, which I hope all of you will before Tuesday, Senator Sanders' long interview with the "New York Daily News," talk about judgment and talk about the kinds of problems he had answering questions about even his core issue, breaking up the banks. When asked, he could not explain how...[laughter]...that would be done and...[applause]...when asked...[applause]...when asked about a number of foreign policy issues, he could not answer about Afghanistan, about Israel, about counterterrorism, except to say if he'd had some paper in front of him, maybe he could. I think you need to have the judgment on day one to be both president and commander-in-chief.
