You know, I like Marco. He's very charming. He's very smooth. But the facts are simple. When he ran for election in the state of Florida, he told the people of Florida, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty." When I ran in Texas, I told the people of Texas, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty." We both made the identical promises. But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice. Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors â€” to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous. [bell rings] I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country. [applause]
