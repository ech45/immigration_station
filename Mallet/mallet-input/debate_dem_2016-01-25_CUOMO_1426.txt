You mentioned President Obama. He was speaking this morning about the election a little bit more deeply than he has in the past. And he was doing an analysis of Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders. And he referred to the senator as kind of this bright shiny new object and that has a fascination for people. I thought you were supposed to be the bright, shiny new object in this.
