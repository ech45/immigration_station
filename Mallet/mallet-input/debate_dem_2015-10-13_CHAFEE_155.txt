OK. I just have to answer one thing that Senator Webb said about the Iran deal, because I'm a strong proponent of what President Obama â€” and he said that because of that the Iran deal that enabled Russia to come in. No, that's not true, Senator Webb. I respect your foreign policy chops. But Russia is aligned with Iran and with Assad and the Alawite Shias in Syria. So that Iran deal did not allow Russia to come in.
