I think what Secretary Clinton just said is absolutely right. I think I said it many months before she said it, but thanks for copying a very good idea. [applause] Now the question though, you know, I have been criticized a lot for thinking big. You know, that's for believing that we can do great things as a nation. One of the things we should not be doing obviously, is punishing people for doing what we want them to do and that is to get an education. [applause] But here is the point. My program, making public colleges and universities tuition free, allowing people with debt to refinance at the lowest possible interest rates is a fairly expensive proposal, about $70 billion a year. You know how I'm going to pay for it? I'm going to pay for it by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation. [applause] We bailed out â€” Secretary Clinton was one of those who voted to bail out Wall Street. Now I think it's time for Wall Street to help the working families of this country.
