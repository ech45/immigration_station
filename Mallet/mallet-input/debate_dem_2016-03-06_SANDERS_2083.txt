If I understand — and — you know, as I understand it, what you're really talking about is not what Secretary Clinton is responding to. As I understand it — and maybe I'm wrong on this, but what you were essentially saying, and what people are saying, is that, if somebody who is crazy or a criminal or a horrible person goes around shooting people, the manufacturer of that gun should be held liable. And if that is your position, then what you are saying, essentially — if that is the case, as I understand it — it's not what Secretary Clinton is talking about. I agree with what she said. But if that is the case, then essentially, your position is there should not be any guns in America, period. [crosstalk]
