I don't think so, Chris. If you sell, if you are a small gun shop owner and you sell somebody a gun, legally, all right, you don't do anything wrong. That's what you do. You sell guns. Somebody buys the gun and then goes out and kills somebody, do I think that gun shop owner should be held liable? I don't.
