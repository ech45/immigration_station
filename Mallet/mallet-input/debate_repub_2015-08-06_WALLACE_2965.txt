Thank you, sir. [applause] Mr. Trump, it has not escaped anybody's notice that you say that the Mexican government, the Mexican government is sending criminals ...rapists, drug dealers, across the border. Governor Bush has called those remarks, quote, "extraordinarily ugly." I'd like you ...you're right next to him ...tell us ...talk to him directly and say how you respond to that and ...and you have repeatedly said that you have evidence that the Mexican government is doing this, but you have evidence you have refused or declined to share. Why not use this first Republican presidential debate to share your proof with the American people?
