Well, one more point, one more point, Chris. I'm trying to win her vote. Leave me alone here. [laughter] All right. Hillary Clinton and I have a disagreement on a very important issue that impacts everybody, but especially women.

Ask Hillary Clinton if she's prepared to lift the cap on taxable income. [applause]
