First of all, only ISIS is responsible for the terrorism. Only ISIS is responsible for the depravity. But, we do have to examine, how are we going to defeat ISIS? I've got a proposal. I'm the leading voice in America for not arming the allies of ISIS. [applause] I've been fighting amidst a lot of opposition from both Hillary Clinton, as well as some Republicans who wanted to send arms to the allies of ISIS. ISIS rides around in a billion dollars worth of U.S. Humvees. It's a disgrace. We've got to stop ...we shouldn't fund our enemies, for goodness sakes. So, we didn't create ISIS ...ISIS created themselves, but we will stop them, and one of the ways we stop them is by not funding them, and not arming them. [applause]
