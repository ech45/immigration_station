Thank you, Jake. Tomorrow is — Republicans know this — tomorrow is Constitution Day. We've been talking about the 10th Amendment. Let's talk about the Second Amendment. Governor Bush, one of the things the Supreme Court has gotten right is that it's an individual right and it's protected for individuals to hold it. Last week, you said the next step in gun issues is to make sure they're not in the hands of mentally ill. In this state, there's a controversial law that allows guns to be taken away from people without a hearing. Where does it go — and the problem of violence is endemic, but where does it go from what you said last week, how far into people's lives to take guns away from them?
