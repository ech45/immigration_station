Our freedom is under attack. Our economy is under water. The leading democrat is under investigation. And America is under the gun to lead the free world to protect our civilized way of life. Serious times require strong leadership, that's what at stake right now. Regarding national security, we need to restore the defense cuts of Barack Obama to rebuild our military, to destroy ISIS before it destroys us. Regarding economic security, we need to take power and money away from Washington D.C. and empower American families so that they can rise up again. Look, America still is an exceptional country. We love to lead and we love to win. And we do it, when we take on any challenge and when we take â€“ we support our friends. As president, I will keep you and our country safe, secure, and free. Thank you.
