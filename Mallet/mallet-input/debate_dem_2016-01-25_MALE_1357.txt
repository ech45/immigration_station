The world a president has to grapple with - sometimes you can't even imagine. That's the job and she's prepared for it like no other, a tireless secretary of State, standing up against the abuse of women and girls, negotiating a cease-fire in Gaza, leading the diplomacy that keeps us out of war. The presidency is the toughest job in the world and she's the one leader who has what it takes to get every part of the job done.
