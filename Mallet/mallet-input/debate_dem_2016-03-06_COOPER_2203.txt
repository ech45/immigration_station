Welcome back to the CNN Democratic Presidential Debate. Thanks very much for joining us. [applause] Secretary Clinton, I want to ask you about something you talked about this morning. You said this morning, about your emails, that you expect the investigation to be wrapped up soon. The Republican front-runner, Donald Trump says, he's going to talk about your emails every single day if he is the nominee and out on the campaign trail. Democrats want to know, your supporters want to know, if you're the nominee, how are you going to take him on?
