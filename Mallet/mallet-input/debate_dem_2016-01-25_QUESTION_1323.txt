Senator Sanders, you have branded your program, your single payer health program as "Medicare for All", and Medicare has a reputation of having some problems. Let me cite one example, a man in our clinic went into the Donut Hole in September and could not afford the $1,200 a month it would cost him for insulin. So, he had to decrease his dose to make his insulin stretch. So, what do you - why do you think that people would support your medicare for all program?
