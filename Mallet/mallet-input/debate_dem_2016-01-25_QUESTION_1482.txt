My question is about beginning farmers. I'm a beginning farmer. The average age of farmers in the United States right now is about 57 years old, and that number goes up a little bit each year. For beginning farmers, a group that includes a growing number of veterans, women farmers like me and other groups. We do have some opportunities with innovative business models that include more diversified farms, or sustainable farming practice, but there aren't nearly enough of us. We know that a lot of farmers are going to be retiring in the next decade, and there aren't enough people to replace them, so my question is after decades of rural outmigration, and farm consolidation, what can we do? What would you do to provide opportunities and invest in a new generation of family farms for the country?
