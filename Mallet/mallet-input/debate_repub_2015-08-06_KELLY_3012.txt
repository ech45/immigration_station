Senator Cruz, I wanna talk to you about this, because many of the Facebook users and ...and ...the ...the folks on Facebook wanted the candidates to speak to ISIS tonight. You asked the chairman of the joint chiefs a question: "What would it take to destroy ISIS in 90 days?" He told you "IISIS will only be truly destroyed once they are rejected by the populations in which they hide." And then you accused him of pushing Medicaid for the Iraqis. How would you destroy ISIS in 90 days?
