I woke up one night thinking that maybe I could see, if Donald Trump was sitting here, maybe he'd punch Gowdy out. [laughter] OK. Here's the question, practically all of the comments that have been said for both - all three candidates tonight, about 99 percent, have been on some form of domestic policy. And yet, you know, as the former wife of a president and as the secretary of state, that the president of the United States is going to just spend more than 50 percent of his or her time on foreign policy issues. So therefore, I think it's important for the public to kind of get a sense of where you may be coming from across the board philosophically. And the way I look at it is you could have a scale of say, one to 100, and on that scale, you would have none interventionist on one side at one, and total interventionist on the other side as 10. As you think about all the issues that you've confronted as secretary of state, and then as the possibility of looking at issues into the future, where do you think you'll land on that scale of one to 10?
