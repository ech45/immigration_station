I do. I believe that the great majority of people coming here illegally have no other option. They want to provide for their family. But we need to control our border. It's not ...it's our responsibility to pick and choose who comes in. So I ...I've written a book about this and yet this week, I did come up with a comprehensive strategy that ...that really mirrored what we said in the book, which is that we need to deal with E-Verify, we need to deal with people that come with a legal visa and overstay. We need to be much more strategic on how we deal with border enforcement, border security. We need to eliminate the sanctuary cities in this country. It is ridiculous and tragic...[applause]...that people are dying because of the fact that ...that local governments are not following the federal law. There's much to do. And I think rather than talking about this as a wedge issue, which Barack Obama has done now for six long years, the next president ...and I hope to be that president ...will fix this once and for all so that we can turn this into a driver for high sustained economic growth. And there should be a path to earned legal status...[timer sounds] ...for those that are here. Not ...not amnesty, earned legal status, which means you pay a fine and do many things over an extended period of time.
