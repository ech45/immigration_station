Welcome to CNN's Republican Presidential Debate. No topic perhaps has been more combustible in this campaign than the issue of immigration. Mr. Trump, you have called for deporting every undocumented immigrant, Governor Christie has said, quote, "There are not enough law enforcement officers — local, county, state and federal combined — to forcibly deport 11 to 12 million people." Tell Governor Christie how much your plan will cost, and how you will get it done.
