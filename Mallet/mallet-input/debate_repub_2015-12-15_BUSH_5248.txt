This is another example of the lack of seriousness. Look, this is — this is troubling because we're at war. They've declared war on us and we need to have a serious strategy to destroy ISIS. But the idea that that is a solution to this is just — is just crazy. It makes no sense to suggest this. Look, two months ago Donald Trump said that ISIS was not our fight. Just two months ago he said that Hillary Clinton would be a great negotiator with Iran. And he gets his foreign policy experience from the shows. That is not a serious kind of candidate. We need someone that thinks this through. That can lead our country to safety and security. [applause]
