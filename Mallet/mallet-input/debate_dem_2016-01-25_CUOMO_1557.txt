On that issue, the Des Moines Register, as we said earlier, gave you an endorsement. [applause] Did it question your judgment, though, when it came to the email issue? They said, and you know this, but for the audience, in 2008 "when she says" - "when she makes a mistake she should just say so." This weekend they said that's a lesson that you have not learned. Yes, you apologized, but only when you needed to, not when you first could have. Fair criticism?
