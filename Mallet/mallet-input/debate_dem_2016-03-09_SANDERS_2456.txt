Now, let me say this. I gather Secretary Clinton hasn't listened to too many of my speeches. [laughter] Or followed my work in the Congress as very few people stood up to George W. Bush whether it was the war in Iraq or any other of his policies. [laughter] Now, when we talk about the policies of the 1990s, I worked closely and supported President Clinton. And obviously, I have worked very closely in supporting President Obama, who has taken our economy a very long way from where Bush left us. But when you go back to the 1990s, let's remember, that's when Wall Street deregulation took place.
