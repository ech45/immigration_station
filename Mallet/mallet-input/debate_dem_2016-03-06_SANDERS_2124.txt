No, well, he has given us a good, good basis and foundation. We have got to do better than that. And of course we should. But here's what I would do. I would end â€” I would make sure that the Department of Justice investigated every killing of a citizen of this country when they are under apprehension from a police officer or when they are killed in police custody. I would end the militarization of local police departments. [applause] I would develop model programs to make police departments look like the communities that they serve. I would end minimal sentencing and give judges more discretion. I would recognize that substance abuse and drug addiction is a health issue, not a criminal issue. [applause] And I would make sure that those people who left jail had the education and job training so they don't go back into the same environment which got them in jail in the first place.
