Secretary Clinton... [crosstalk] You will respond in a moment, but I have to follow-up with Secretary Clinton. You stood on the stage with Governor Cuomo in support of new legislation to raise New York's minimum wage to $15 an hour. But you do not support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. As president...[applause]...if a Democratic Congress put a $15 minimum wage bill on your desk, would you sign it?
