Good evening. I'm John Dickerson. This holiday weekend, as America honors our first president, we're about to hear from six men who hope to be the 45th. The candidates for the Republican nomination are here in South Carolina for their ninth debate, one week before this state holds the first-in-the-South primary. George Washington wrote that the truth will ultimately prevail where there is pains taken to bring it to light. We hope to shed some light on the candidates' positions tonight to help voters make up their minds. So gentlemen, please join us on stage. [applause] With us tonight â€” with us tonight are retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson of Florida, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. [applause] Businessman Donald Trump of New York. [applause] Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. [applause] Former Governor Jeb Bush of Florida. [applause] And Governor John Kasich of Ohio. [applause] Now, as most of you have heard by now, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died today at the age of 79. He was the longest-serving member of the court, appointed by President Reagan in 1986. Justice Scalia was the court's leading conservative, and even those who disagreed with his opinions regarded him as a brilliant legal scholar. Please join us and the candidates on our stage in a moment of silence for Justice Antonin Scalia. Thank you. We will talk to the candidates about Justice Scalia and the road ahead when the debate begins in a moment.
