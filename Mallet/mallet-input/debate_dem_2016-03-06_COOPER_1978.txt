I want to go to Lee-Anne Walters. This is Lee-Anne Walters. She was one of the first people to report problems with the water in Flint. One of her twin boys stopped growing. Her daughter lost her hair. She says she's undecided, and has a question for both of you to answer, but we'll start with Senator Sanders. Ms. Walters?
