Thank you, Ms. Fiorina. We appreciate it. Thank you, thank you. I want to turn my attention now, to you now, Governor Kasich. Most people can't get a college degree without going into debt. Over 40 million Americans have student loans and many of them cannot pay them back. This country has over $100 billion in student loan defaults. That's billion with a b. What will you do to make sure that students, their families, taxpayers, won't feel the economic impact of this burden for generations?
