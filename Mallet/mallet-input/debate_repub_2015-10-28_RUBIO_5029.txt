Thank you. Well, I've learned the rules on this. [laughter] Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legalimmigration system for permanent residents. Today, we have a legalimmigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here. And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956. But in 2015, we have a very different economy. Our legalimmigration system from now on has to be merit-based. It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
