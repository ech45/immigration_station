Well, let me say a couple of things. First of all, Marco said earlier on that President Obama knows exactly what he's doing, like we have this president that really knows. I disagree, respectfully, with Marco. I think we have a president who, as a president, is totally incompetent, and he doesn't know what he's doing. [applause] I think he has no idea what he's doing. And our country is going to hell. So, I just want to say, we disagree on that. Is that okay?
