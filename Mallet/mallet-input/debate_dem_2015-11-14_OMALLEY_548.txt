$10.10 was all I could get the state to do by the time I left in my last year. But two of our counties actually went to $12.80 and their county executives, if they were here tonight, would also tell you that it works. The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows. That's American capitalism.
