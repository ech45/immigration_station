Well, that's going to be up to the legal system, Don. I mean, I can't standing here â€” I don't have all the facts, but people should be held accountable wherever that leads. If it leads to resignation, or recall if you're in political office. If it leads to civil penalties, if it leads to criminal responsibility. There has to be an absolute accountability, and I will support whatever the outcome of those investigations are.
