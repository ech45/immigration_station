We also have a big crowd here with us tonight in the home of the Cavaliers, as I mentioned. And while we expect them... [applause] ... we expect them to be enthusiastic, as you heard, we don't want to take anything away from the valuable time for the candidate. So, we're looking for somewhere between a reaction to a LeBron James dunk and the Cleveland Public Library across the street. [laughter] Somewhere there, we'll find a balance tonight. Without further ado, let's begin.
