Thank you. Let's be clear. You're looking at the senator who introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation in the history of the United States Senate. [applause] Now, I hope that Secretary Clinton would join me if we are serious about climate change, about imposing a tax on carbon on the fossil fuel industry and making massive investments in energy efficiency and sustainable energy. And by the way, while we are on the subject of energy, I hope you'll join me in ending fracking in the United States of America. [applause] [crosstalk]
